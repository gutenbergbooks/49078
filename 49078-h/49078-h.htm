<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>During the past year I have seen enquiries
for a book on the management of Shire
Horses; therefore I have made an attempt
to supply the want. That the result leaves
much&mdash;very much&mdash;to be desired I am well
aware, but at least the little work is free
from fine phrases and technical terms. Farmers
prefer practical advice to literary merit in
any book, or paper, that they read, and
this is written by one of their own class.</p>

<p>For six months England has been engaged
in war, the most awful yet waged for the
reason that half the world is involved in it.
It naturally follows that little is read but
war news. Consequently these pages will be
regarded as dull and uninteresting by those
who have become accustomed to thrilling
stories from battlefields, seas, or skies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>By those who take an interest in the
world’s heaviest breed of horses, as well as
war news, this book may be tolerated, seeing
that it deals with the old “War Horse” of
Britain, many true descendants being actively
engaged in moving “tons and guns” at the
present time. I make no claim to having
written anything new, but as a kind of pocket
record of what Shire breeders, and exhibitors,
have hitherto accomplished with their animals
the facts herein contained may be useful, and
I hope that all readers, as well as Shire
breeders, will forgive any inaccuracies in my
figures and all the imperfections in this my
first attempt at book-writing.</p>

<p>In 1899 I won a small prize, offered by
an agricultural paper for a short article entitled
“Rent-Paying Horses,” which I tried
to point out were Shire Horses. Since then
I have contributed a little to the live stock
papers on the same subject, including an
article for the <i>Farmer and Stockbreeder Year
Book</i> of 1906, which is reprinted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
editor’s permission. It was over the initials
“S. H. L.,” which mean “Shire Horse Lover.”
I have been that from my school days, but
never a greater one than now.</p>

<h1>THE SHIRE HORSE IN PEACE AND WAR</h1>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">A Popular Breed</span></h2>

<p>There is no breed of horses which has
attracted so much attention during the past
thirty years as the Old English War Horse.
Originally bred and preserved for fighting
purposes, his size was increased by importations
of stallions and mares from Flanders&mdash;famous
now and henceforth as the battleground
of the greatest war ever waged. In the days
when heavy armour was worn the cavalry horse
could hardly be too stout, and at that time
ploughing was performed by oxen; but there
came a day when the English knights discarded
their coats of mail and thenceforward
sought for light-legged mounts. This gave the
horses bred in “the Shires” a chance to distinguish
themselves as draught horses, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
which their width of chest, short legs, and
strong back were well adapted: so the War
Horse of the olden days became the Old
English Cart Horse.</p>

<p>Farmers&mdash;particularly Robert Bakewell&mdash;discovered
that they could do double, or treble,
the quantity of ploughing with a pair of these
heavy horses that they could with an ox team;
therefore draught horses superseded bullocks
for agricultural and haulage purposes, which
meant that they were bred for weight and
substance, the biggest and heaviest being
regarded as the best.</p>

<p>Pedigrees of these massive animals were
kept by a few progressive breeders from the
year 1800, at least; therefore it was not difficult
to compile a stud book for this Old English
breed when a society, to protect its interests,
and promote its breeding, was formed in 1878
by a body of admirers, among whom the late
Sir Walter Gilbey was conspicuous. Included
were also the Earl of Ellesmere, Earl Spencer,
Lord Wantage, Lord Egerton of Tatton, the
Hon. Edward Coke, Mr. Chandos Pole-Gell,
Mr. Anthony Hamond, and Messrs. George
and Frederic Street, while H.R.H. the Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of Wales (King Edward VII) was a keen
supporter of the Shire Horse Society from its
inception.</p>

<p>All of those named have passed away; but
not before they had seen their efforts bear rich
fruit in the rapid establishment of the industry
of Shire Horse breeding at home, and the
world-wide fame achieved by the breed abroad,
but particularly in the United States of America,
to which country the majority of those exported
have been sent.</p>

<p>Great changes have occurred since the
Hon. E. Coke’s dispersion sale at Longford
Hall, Derby, in October, 1889, this being the
first of which the writer possesses a catalogue.
It was caused by his death, and his stud
manager went from thence to take charge of
the Royal Stud of Shires at Sandringham for
King Edward, who proved to be a very
successful breeder. Two champion mares,
Gloaming and Solace, were bred, and more
than one successful sale held at Sandringham
in the ’nineties of last century, a decade during
which it became the fashion for landowners
and wealthy men to own a stud of Shires so
that they almost tumbled over each other to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
secure the most notable specimens for their
studs. (The last sale of King Edward’s Shires
was held at Wolferton in 1907.) The result
was a reign of high prices which led many
farmers to believe that Shire Horse breeding
was beyond the reach of their pockets. Stud
sales to the number of ten or twelve were held
each year from 1890 to 1902, when the total
was fourteen and the number of Shires sold 583,
after which they began to dwindle till the past
year of 1914, during which there was not a
single home sale.</p>

<p>To an outsider this might be taken to
prove that the love and enthusiasm for the
Old English breed had fizzled out, that the
Shire had been “weighed in the balances and
found wanting.” Nothing could be further
from the truth. The last home sale held
was the most successful that ever took place.
Thirty-two animals, including several yearlings,
averaged £454 each at Lord Rothschild’s sale
on February 14th, 1913, one two-year-old colt,
Champion’s Goalkeeper, making the record
price for a Shire of 4,100 guineas. After this
one may well wonder why such a good method
of selling has been abandoned. The chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
reason is that the industry is no longer confined
to those who live in mansions, or think&mdash;financially&mdash;in
thousands. It has become part
of the routine of hundreds of English tenant
farmers to rear Shire horses, and as they have
only a few animals to offer at one time the
Repository Sale has superseded the Home
gathering, helpful though these fraternal
meetings have always proved to the breed’s
interests.</p>

<p>As before stated, most of those who held
sales have gone the way of all flesh, but besides
those already named may be mentioned Sir
P. A. Muntz, Lord Llangattock, Mr. John
Parnell, Mr. Fred Crisp, Mr. Philo L. Mills,
Mr. James Eadie, Mr. Arthur Ransom, and
Mr. J. A. Barrs. All of these were buyers,
breeders, and exhibitors of the best in their
day, together with others too numerous to
mention.</p>

<p>The loss of these supporters has, however,
been made good by new ones, more numerous,
if less influential; therefore the Shire breeding
industry has never been on a broader base
than it is to-day.</p>

<p>These lines are being written when horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
are in greater demand for war purposes than
they have ever been before in the world’s
history, and although the Shire has for generations
been transformed into a peace, rather
than a war, horse he has not escaped the notice
of the army buyer. We have it on the best
authority&mdash;that of the official auctioneer to
the Shire Horse Society&mdash;that “many a pure-bred
Shire mare and gelding are now pulling
heavy guns and transport waggons in France
and Belgium, besides which nearly all the best
gunners are by Shire stallions.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to point out that
the best Shires of this period weigh over one
ton, and to pull weight you must have weighty
animals; therefore these massive modern cart
horses are just as useful in hauling heavy
guns, the most effective weapons in modern
warfare, as their ancestors were in carrying
the bold British knights cased from head to
foot in steel armour.</p>

<p>But war, though it lasts long&mdash;too long&mdash;comes
to an end, and when this one does
horses will be wanted in thousands to make
up for those lost by the eight or nine nations
now fighting for their existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>It is perfectly clear that the great studs
of Shires as they existed a few years ago are
being dispersed. Very few breeders of the
present time could have sixty high class
animals paraded, as the late Lord Ellesmere
did for the benefit of visitors to the Worsley
show in August, 1889; but scores of farmers
could muster a team or two of good Shire
mares; therefore it is obvious that, whatever
the future of the Shire may be, English farmers
will do much towards shaping it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">Founding a Stud</span></h2>

<p>As this little book is intended for farmers more
than for stud owners, a better heading for this
chapter would have been “Selecting the Dams,”
for without sound, useful mares no breeder
can hope to achieve success with the horses
he breeds.</p>

<p>It has been possible to grade up one’s old
stock of mares by using registered stallions
until they were eligible for the Stud Book;
but this is too tedious a course to recommend
in these days; moreover, the demand for
draught mares is now so keen that the
difference in the price of a pedigree and a
common non-pedigree mare is scarcely worth
considering. Therefore the beginner who
wishes to breed pedigree Shires should dispose
of his unregistered mares to re-invest his money
in females which are worth mating with a
really good sire, so that the full benefits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the industry may be more quickly forthcoming.</p>

<p>Of course there is a wide range of choice
in Shire mares; consequently there is plenty of
scope for the skill and judgment of the
purchaser. Those which are fashionably bred,
perfectly sound and likely to make prize
winners usually realize high prices, while prizes
already won add considerably to the market
value of any Shire, male or female.</p>

<p>One must decide according to his means
whether he will launch out and buy one or
two of the most famous mares to be obtained,
or whether he will proceed cautiously, and
with as little outlay as possible, by picking up
useful specimens as they come under his
notice; but it may be pointed out that the
man who attends sales and gives sensational
prices advertises himself, thus getting a more
favourable start than the plodder.</p>

<p>The initial, or foundation, stock, whatever
its cost, should be free from hereditary unsoundness,
otherwise disappointment will be
encountered in the offspring.</p>

<p>It is much more easy to find sound Shires
now than it was in the early years of the Shire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Horse Society, when the rejections for unsoundness
were very numerous, as the following
extract from a show report of the past will
prove:&mdash;“The judges selected ten horses to be
sent out for veterinary inspection in the hope,
vain though it proved to be, that at least half
of them would be again found in the ring with
a certificate of soundness, so that no difficulty
would be experienced in securing sufficient
sound animals to which they could award the
three prizes and the reserve number. Not so,
however; and the stewards were compelled to
seek in the boxes for other horses to be sent
out for examination in order that the rosettes
might be placed.”</p>

<p>Unsoundness on such a scale has long
ceased to exist, largely through the efforts of
the Shire Horse Society in sticking to their
rule of giving prizes and commendations to
sound animals only.</p>

<p>This does not imply that unsoundness
cannot be found in the Shires of to-day.
Unfortunately it is still possible to buy a mare,
or use a stallion, with undesirable and readily
inherited complaints; therefore it is very necessary
for farmers&mdash;who wish to make their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Shires do a share towards paying the rent&mdash;to
discriminate between a sound and an unsound
horse, or mare, or to decide for himself whether
to take or refuse a blemished animal. There
are many of the latter which often prove a
good investment, and as a veterinary surgeon
cannot always be found at a moment’s notice it
is desirable for breeders to make themselves
acquainted with the conformation of a sound
and perfectly moulded animal, so as to be able
to rely on one’s own judgment when buying or
selling.</p>

<p>Shire Horse history has proved that the
purchase of one sound mare with good back
breeding has led to fame and fortune, a fact
which should not be forgotten when home
breeding is being embarked upon or extended.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">The Selection of Sires</span></h2>

<p>The question of mating is one of great importance
in the breeding of any class of live
stock, hence the necessity of rejecting a commonplace
sire whether he is to be purchased
or only patronized for nominations.</p>

<p>The cheap sire is common enough even in
these days, and the fact that his services cost
little gives him a popularity altogether unmerited
and very injurious to the best interests
of Shire breeding. Quite recently I saw
twenty quarters of wheat delivered by a small
farmer from whom it was purchased. In one
of the carts I was surprised to find a five-year-old
stallion, light in bone, pale chestnut in
colour, and quite small&mdash;just the sort to haul
guns or baggage to “the front” at the present
time, but obviously unfit to serve a mare if a
weighty cart horse was expected as the result.
Yet the owner claimed to have got a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
mares to this horse for the past two seasons.
This sort of thing going on all over the
country, naturally lowers the standard. A
farmer saves a yearling colt because he “likes
the look of it.” At two years old he uses him
on his own mares and invites his neighbours
to send theirs, the terms being something like
£1 each mare, or, perhaps, “No colt, no pay,”
and £1 10<i>s.</i> if the mare proves to be in foal.</p>

<p>Such a system of breeding may help to
increase the horse population, and those bred
in this haphazard fashion may find a ready
market while a great war is in progress, but
it is not Shire breeding in the true sense;
therefore a farmer who possesses even a useful
mare should not object to paying a reasonable
service fee, or, if he uses his neighbour’s
horse, he should at least ascertain if he is
sound and of good parentage.</p>

<p>The work of the Shire Horse Society is to
“improve the Old English Breed of Cart
Horses.” It has been carried on for thirty-six
years very successfully, notwithstanding the
injurious effect wrought by such stallions as
that above mentioned, and it rests with the
present members of the Shire Horse Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to carry on the work which, as aforesaid, was
so well begun and maintained by such men as
the late Sir Walter Gilbey, to whom all lovers
of Shire Horses are indebted for his book on
“The Great Horse,” which gives the history
of the breed from the time of the Roman
Invasion till the year 1889 (when the first
edition of the book appeared), at which date
Shire Horse breeding had become a great
national industry, that year having been the
best on record for the number of export
certificates granted. A second edition brings
the work up to 1899.</p>

<p>When wealthy stud owners place the best of
stallions within the reach of tenant farmers it is
a mistake to miss the opportunity, but those less
fortunately placed are now able, if they desire to
do so, to profit by the Development Grant of
the State, which enables them to get mares to
sound&mdash;if not front rank&mdash;stallions at low fees
or by assisted nominations. That a horse
breeder should be content to mate his mares
with a mongrel when it is easily possible to aim
higher seems difficult to understand in these
days when pedigree means so much in market
value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>For the production of geldings, fashionable
blood is not essential, but it sometimes happens
that a foal of outstanding merit is bred by
quite a small farmer, and if such an one is by a
well-known sire of prize-winning stock, a real
good price may be obtained, if the dam is only
registered, so there is much to be said in favour
of using the highest type of Shire stallion, even
by owners of one or two mares. Fortunately
farmers are able to secure special terms for
their mares from most stud owners, and there
are many local societies which hire a real good
horse and charge a smaller sum to their own
members than to outsiders. Among such
societies may be mentioned Peterborough,
Welshpool, and Winslow, in all of which districts
many high-class Shires have been bred. Then
there are generous landlords who hire a real
good horse for the benefit of their tenants&mdash;although
not Shire breeders themselves&mdash;so
that it is quite possible for the majority of
tenant farmers to obtain nominations to one
of the best of Shire stallions if he is bent on improvement
and believes in being enterprising
enough to obtain it. The indifference which
leads horse breeders to use a mongrel which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
comes into the yard, rather than send further
afield to a better animal is inexcusable in a
member of the Shire Horse Society, neither is
such an one likely to improve his financial position
by means of his heavy horses, which large
numbers of farmers have done during the
depressed times. An extra five pounds for a
service fee may be, and often is, fifty when the
foal is sold.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">Breeding from Fillies</span></h2>

<p>For many years it has been a debatable point
whether two-year-old fillies should be bred from
or not. The pros and cons have been discussed,
and in the end Shire breeders have used their
own discretion on the point. Superior animals
have, however, been bred from youthful parents
on both sides, a notable instance being the late
Lord Wantage’s Lady Victoria; her sire was
Prince William, the London and Royal Champion,
and her dam Glow, by the London
Champion Spark. She was the first foal of a
two-year-old colt, with a two-year-old filly for
her dam, yet she made a great prize-winning
mare, having won first and cup in London in
1889 and championship of the Oxfordshire Show
in 1890.</p>

<p>It may also be mentioned that Buscot Harold,
the London Champion stallion of 1898, was
begotten when his sire, Markeaton Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Harold, was but a two-year-old colt, although
his dam, Aurea, was older. At two years old
he was preferred to his sire for the Elsenham
Challenge Cup.</p>

<p>This proves that Shire breeders have been
making good use of fillies for many years,
therefore the produce of a three-year-old filly
need not be rejected, neither should the nursing
of a foal at that age necessarily result in a
stunted or plain mare. It is, however, necessary
to grow fillies along with the aid of supplementary
food and to “do” both them and their
foals well while they are suckling.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Shires of the
present day do get more food and attention
than they did in bygone days, when it was unnecessary
to strive after showyard size, because
shows did not exist in such numbers, so that the
farmer who exhibited cart horses was rarely met
with, and young horse stock were not fed to
encourage size and growth. So long as they
could be put into the team at three years old
and mated at four, that was considered early
enough to work or to breed.</p>

<p>At the present time the horse population of
Great Britain and Europe, if not of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
world, is being reduced by the greatest of all
wars, consequently it is desirable for Shire
breeders to do their share towards making
good the shortage. If fillies are well kept
from birth they will attain size and may be
mated at two years old to a young horse, but
not too early in the season. The end of May
is early enough for fillies, and a big heavy
old horse should not be chosen under any
circumstances. If served at the right time
they are more likely to breed than fillies a
year older, and it makes a lot of difference
whether a five-year-old mare has a couple of
sons and daughters or even one to her credit,
or no offspring at all, when the profit and loss
account is being made up by a farmer.</p>

<p>It may be that a three-year-old cannot be
got into a fat state for show with a foal running
by her side, but the prolonged rest at that age
does her no harm. She will come up all right
at a later period, and is more likely to make a
regular breeder than if not mated till three
years old. A mare which breeds from the age
of three till she is fifteen is a great help in the
way of production, even if she only averages
one foal in two years, which is, perhaps, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
many as it is safe to reckon on for rearing to
maturity, although, of course, there are plenty
of mares which have produced a good foal for
ten or eleven years in succession. They will
breed till they are twenty-five, to the writer’s
knowledge, but the average age at which Shire
mares breed their last foal must be put somewhere
round fifteen.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that we have learned
much in horse management since shows have
become so popular, although it may be that
high feeding for show purposes has been&mdash;and
is&mdash;the cause of a lower percentage of foals
among high class show animals of both sexes.</p>

<p>To prepare fillies for mating at two years
old may be compared to feeding for early
maturity in cattle and sheep, except that many
of the latter are only grown and fattened to be
killed, whereas Shires are meant to live a long
and useful life. It is, therefore, necessary to
build up a frame with this idea in view. An outdoor
life should be led, while the food should
be both good and sufficient, as well as being
suitable.</p>

<p>There is no time to be wasted, and if foals
are allowed to get into low condition while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
being weaned, or during their first winter, they
are less fit to make robust two-year-olds fit
either to work or to breed, or what is more
profitable, to accomplish both of these tasks
together during part of the year.</p>

<p>If early maturity is aimed at with any class
of stock, feeding and management must be
of the best, therefore farmers who half starve
their foals and allow their yearlings to be
wintered on a bit of hay must not expect their
two-year-olds to be well grown and in the best
possible condition for parental duties.</p>

<p>The situation at the present time is such
that every horse-breeder should do his best to
utilize to the full the horse stock which he
possesses, so that a sufficient number of horses
may be obtained to carry on the agriculture
and trade of the country, both of which are
likely to require horses in large numbers in the
immediate future.</p>

<p>Mares will be relatively more scarce than
stallions for the reason that the latter have not
been “commandeered” for war purposes, but
as geldings have been taken in large numbers,
there is, and will be, a great demand for workers
of all grades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Under such circumstances Shire breeders
may serve their own interests by mating their
fillies with a good young sire at two years old
and keeping them in good condition for producing
a strong vigorous foal. Very few of
Robert Bakewell’s remarks are recorded, but
this one is, “The only way to be sure of good
offspring is to have good cows as well as good
bulls,” and this applies with equal, if not greater,
force in the business of horse-breeding; the sire
cannot effect the whole of the improvement.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">Team Work</span></h2>

<p>Since my very youthful days I have always
been accustomed to putting cart colts into the
team at two years old, a system which cannot
be too strongly advocated at the present time,
when every worker in the shape of a horse is
needed.</p>

<p>There are numbers of high-class Shires
living a life of luxurious idleness to-day, for
the only reason that they were never trained
to work, yet they would be quite as well in
health, and more likely to breed, if they were
helping to do ploughing or almost any kind of
farm work when not actually nursing a foal or
being prepared for any important show.</p>

<p>When a Shire mare can be sold as “a
good worker,” a buyer feels that he is getting
something for his money, even if she fails to
breed, so that there is much to be said in
favour of putting fillies into the team, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
nothing against, so far as I know, unless they
are over-worked, strained, or stunted.</p>

<p>A non-breeding mare which will not work
is an impossible, or useless, sort of animal on a
farm, where mere ornaments are not required,
whereas if she is a worker in all gears she is
“anybody’s mare”; on the other hand, she is
nobody’s if she refuses either to work or to
breed.</p>

<p>Geldings for haulage purposes are always
in demand, but big powerful mares are equally
useful for the same purpose, and it is much
better to sell a non-breeder for the lorry than
to sell her for another breeder to meet with
disappointment. It is obvious that there will
be a great scarcity of weighty working horses
when the countries now involved in war settle
down to peaceful trades and occupations, and
there is no country which stands to benefit
more than Great Britain, which is the best of
all breeding grounds for draught horses.</p>

<p>To allow, what would otherwise be, a useful
worker to eat the bread of idleness because
it was regarded as too well bred or valuable
to wear a collar is not a policy to pursue or
to recommend, especially to farmers, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
that the arable land tenant can put a colt
into the team, between two steady horses at
almost any time of the year, while the
occupiers of grass farms may easily start
their young Shires as workers by hitching
them to a log of wood or some chain harrows,
and afterwards work them in a roll.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, whatever, that many
stallions would leave a much higher percentage
of foals if they were “broken in” during their
two-year-old days, so that they would take
naturally to work when they grew older and
could therefore be relied upon to work and
thus keep down superfluous fat. This would
be far better than allowing them to spend
something like nine months of the year in
a box or small paddock with nothing to do
but eat.</p>

<p>In past times more working stallions could
be found, and they were almost invariably good
stock getters, but since showing has become
popular it is almost a general rule to keep
well-bred, or prize-winning, colts quite clear
of the collar lest they should work themselves
down in condition and so fail to please possible
buyers on the look-out for show candidates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>A little more than twenty years ago there
was an outcry against show condition in Shires,
and this is what a very eminent breeder of
those days said on the subject of fat&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a matter of no consequence to any
one, save their owners, when second or third-class
horses are laden with blubber; but it
is a national calamity when the best animals&mdash;those
that ought to be the proud sires and
dams of an ever-improving race&mdash;are stuffed
with treacle and drugged with poisons in order
to compete successfully with their inferiors.
Hence come fever in the feet, diseased livers,
fatty degeneration of the heart, and a host
of ailments that often shorten the lives of their
victims and always injure their constitutions.”</p></div>

<p>This bears out my contention that Shires
of both sexes would pay for a course of
training in actual collar work, no matter how
blue-blooded as regards ancestry or how
promising for the show ring. The fact that
a colt by a London champion had been seen
in the plough team, or between a pair of
shafts, would not detract from his value in
the eyes of a judge, or prevent him from becoming
a weighty and muscular horse; in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
it would tend to the development of the arms
and thighs which one expects to find in a
Shire stallion, and if from any cause a stud
or show career is closed, a useful one at
honest work may still be carried on.</p>

<p>Wealthy stud owners can afford to pay
grooms to exercise their horses, but farmers
find&mdash;and are more than ever likely to find&mdash;that
it is necessary to make the best possible
use of their men; therefore, if their colts and
fillies are put to work and rendered perfectly
tractable, they will grow up as stallions which
may be worked instead of being aimlessly
exercised, while the mares can spend at least
half of their lives in helping to carry on the
ordinary work of the farm.</p>

<p>It is certainly worth while to take pains to
train a young Shire, which is worth rearing at
all, to lead from its foalhood days so that it is
always approachable if required for show or
sale, and these early lessons prepare it for the
time when it is old enough to put its shoulders
into the collar, this being done with far less
risk than it is in the case of youngsters
which have been turned away and neglected
till they are three years old. The breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in of this class of colt takes time and strength,
while the task of getting a halter on is no
light one, and the whole business of lungeing,
handling, and harnessing requires more brute
force and courage than the docile animal
trained in infancy calls for.</p>

<p>The secret of training any horse is to keep
it from knowing its own strength; therefore,
if it is taught to lead before it is strong enough
to break away, and to be tied up before it can
break the headcollar by hanging back it is
obvious that less force is required. The horse
which finds he can break his halter by hanging
back is likely to become a troublesome animal
to stand tied up, while the one which throws
its rider two or three times does not forget
that it is possible to get a man off its back;
therefore it is better and safer if they never
gain such knowledge of their own powers.</p>

<p>The Shire breeding farmer ought to be
able to go into his field and put a halter on
any animal required, from a foal to an old
horse, and he can do this if they have been
treated with kindness and handled from their
early days.</p>

<p>This is a matter to which many farmers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
should give more attention than they do, seeing
that an ill-trained show animal may lose
a prize for no other reason than that its show
manners are faulty, whereas those of the
nearest rival are perfect.</p>

<p>The writer was taught this while showing
at a County Show very early in his career.
The animal he was leading was&mdash;like himself&mdash;rather
badly educated, and this was noticed
by one of the oldest and best judges of that
day, and this is what he whispered in his ear,
“My lad, if you would only spend your time
training your horses instead of going to cricket
they would do you more credit and win more
prizes.” This advice I have never forgotten,
and I pass it on for the benefit of those who
have yet to learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> “the ropes.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">Rearing and Feeding</span></h2>

<p>During the past few years we have heard
much about early maturity with all kinds of
stock. Four-year-old bullocks are rarely seen
in these days, while wether sheep are being
superseded by tegs. With Shire Horses there
has been a considerable amount of attention
paid to size in yearlings, two- and three-year-olds,
which, as before stated, is equivalent
to early maturity in the case of cattle and
sheep. For the purpose of getting size an
animal must be well fed from birth, and this
applies to foals. Of course, the date of birth
counts for a good deal when foals are shown
with their dams, as it does to a less extent
with yearlings, but after that age it makes
very little difference whether a foal is born in
February or in May.</p>

<p>From a farmer’s point of view I do not
believe in getting Shire foals too early. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
have to be housed for a lengthened period, and
the dams fed on food which may be expensive.
At the present time good oats are worth
30<i>s.</i> per quarter, and hay, fit for horses, at
least 90<i>s.</i> per ton, so that two or three months
of winter feeding means a little sum added to
the cost of raising a foal.</p>

<p>The middle of April is early enough for
the average foal to arrive, and he can then
make quite a good size by September if his
dam is an ordinarily good suckler and he contracts
no ailments, such as chills or scour, to
check his progress. When colts are a month
old they will begin to pick up crushed oats
and bran while the dam is feeding, therefore
it is no trouble to teach them to eat from a
manger.</p>

<p>A word of caution is necessary to the inexperienced
in the matter of feeding the dam
until the foal is a few days old and strong
enough to take all her milk. This is to feed
the mare sparingly so as not to flush her milk
while the youngster is unable to take it fast
enough. Of course, the surplus can be milked
away, as it should be if the bag is tight, but
this may be neglected and then scour is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
set up, which a very young foal often succumbs
to. It is better that the mare should have too
little than too much milk while the youngster
gets fairly on his legs.</p>

<p>Cows always have most of their milk taken
away, but young lambs as well as foals often
suffer through taking too much of the dam’s
milk during the first day or two of their existence.</p>

<p>If a foal is born during the grazing season
the flow of milk can be regulated by keeping
the mare in a bare pasture, or shutting her up
for part of the day.</p>

<p>Supposing that the foal survives the ills
incidental to its early life, and gains in strength
with the lengthening days, its first dry food
will be taken when the mare is fed, which she
should be, especially if she is either a young
or an old mare, while show candidates will
naturally need something more than grass.
The object is to promote steady growth
and maintain good health, and it should not
be forgotten that oats are the best of all corn
for horses; therefore no other kind should be
given to a foal, but on good grazing land a
mare will usually maintain herself and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
foal in good condition for a good part of the
summer without manger food.</p>

<p>It is towards weaning time that a manger
is needed, into which should be put crushed
(not whole) oats, together with an equal
quantity of bran and a bit of good chaff. At
the outset the mare will eat most of it, but the
foal will benefit by getting richer milk and
more of it, which he can now take without any
ill effects. In time he acquires the habit of
standing up to the manger and taking his
share. It is very necessary to see that all
foals eat well before they are weaned.</p>

<p>The cost of feeding a foal during its first
winter may be roughly reckoned at ten shillings
per week, which is made up as follows&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Feeding costs" style="width: 15em;">
  <tr>
    <td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="tdr"><i>s.</i></td><td class="tdr"><i>d.</i></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>28</td><td class="tdc">”</td><td>carrots</td><td class="tdr">0</td><td class="tdr">3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The bulk of the hay and all the oat straw
should be fed in the form of chaff with the oats,
bran and carrots (well cleaned and pulped),
then a very good everyday diet can be formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
by mixing the whole together, and one which
few horses will refuse. Of course the items
are not reckoned at the extreme prices prevailing
in the winter of 1914-1915, but they could
often be bought for less, so that it is a fair
average.</p>

<p>It will be seen that oats form the biggest
part, for the reason aforesaid, that they are
better than other kinds of corn.</p>

<p>A little long hay should be given at night&mdash;more
when there is snow on the ground&mdash;the
other mixture divided into two feeds per
day, morning and evening, unless showing is
contemplated in the early Spring, when, of
course, an extra feed will be given at mid-day.</p>

<p>The fashion has changed during the past
few years as regards hay for horses. Meadow
hay is regarded, and rightly so, as too soft,
so hard seeds are invariably chosen by grooms
or owners who want value for money.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to ascertain which a horse
likes best by putting some good hard mixture
and equally well-gotten meadow hay side by
side in front of him. He will certainly eat
that first which he likes best, and it will
be found to be the harder mixture. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
quantities mentioned are for foals which lie
out or run on pasture.</p>

<p>The best place for wintering them is in a
paddock or field, with a roomy shed open to
the south. A yard, walled or slabbed on three
sides, the south again being open to the field,
with doors wide enough to admit a cart, is a
very useful addition to the shed, as it is then
possible to shut the youngsters in when
necessary.</p>

<p>Both yard and shed should be kept littered,
if straw is plentiful, but if not the shed should
contain a good bedding of peat-moss litter.
No overhead racks should be used, but one on
the same level as the manger, so that no seeds
drop out of the rack into the colt’s eyes.</p>

<p>It will be found that foals reared in this
way are healthy and ready for their feed, and
they will often prefer to lie full length in the
open than to rest in the shed. To see them
lying quite flat and fast asleep, looking as if
dead, is a pretty sure sign that they are
thriving. They will often snore quite loudly,
so that a novice may consider that they are ill.</p>

<p>Rock salt should be within reach for them
to lick, together with good clean water. If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
trough is used for the latter it should be
cleaned out at intervals, and if a pond or
ditch is the drinking place, there should be a
stone mouth so as to avoid stalking in the
mud. A healthy horse is a hungry horse,
therefore the feed should be cleaned up before
the next is put in. This must be noted in the
case of foals just weaned. Any left over should
be taken away and given to older horses, so
that the little ones receive a sweet and palatable
meal.</p>

<p>Condition and bloom may be obtained by
adding a small quantity of boiled barley or a
handful of linseed meal to the food above
mentioned, while horses lying in should have
a boiled linseed and bran mash about once
a week.</p>

<p>It should be remembered, as before stated,
that horses are not like cattle, sheep, or pigs,
being fattened to be killed. They have a comparatively
long life in front of them, so that it
is necessary to build up a good constitution.
Then they may change hands many times, and
if they pass from where cooked foods and condiments
are largely used to where plain food is
given they are apt to refuse it and lose flesh in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
consequence, thus leading the new owner to
suppose that he has got a bad bargain.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the
pernicious system of stuffing show-animals, and
it is not often that farmers err in this direction.
They are usually satisfied with feeding their
horses on sound and wholesome home-grown
food without purchasing costly extras to make
their horses into choice feeders.</p>

<p>It is always better for the breeder of any
class of stock if the animals he sells give satisfaction
to the purchasers, and this is particularly
true of Shire horses. A doubtful breeder or
one which is not all that it should be may be
fattened up and sold at more than its market
value, but the buyer would not be likely to
go to the same man if he wanted another horse,
therefore it is better to gain a reputation for
honest dealing and to make every effort to
keep it.</p>

<p>It might be here mentioned that it is not
at all satisfactory to rear a Shire foal by itself,
even if it will stay in its paddock. It never
thrives as well as when with company, and often
stands with its head down looking very mopish
and dull, therefore the rearing of Shires is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a suitable undertaking for a small holder,
although he may keep a good brood-mare to
do most of his work and sell her foal at weaning
time.</p>

<p>In the absence of a second foal a donkey is
sometimes used as a companion to a single
one, but he is a somewhat unsatisfactory playfellow,
therefore the farmer with only one had
far better sell it straight from the teat, or if
he has suitable accommodation he should buy
another to lie with it and rear the two together.
Of course, two will need more food than one,
but no more journeys will be required to carry
it to the manger. Care should be taken, however,
to buy one quite as good, and if possible
better, than the home-bred one.</p>

<p>If they are to make geldings the colour
should match, but if for breeding purposes
the colour need not necessarily be the same.
Except for making a working gelding, however,
chestnuts should be avoided. It is not a
desirable colour to propagate, so one can breed
enough of that shade without buying one. A
remark which may be also made with regard to
unsound ones, viz. that most horse-breeders get
enough of them without buying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>During their second summer&mdash;that is as
yearlings&mdash;Shires not wanted for show purposes
should be able to do themselves well at
grass, supposing the land is of average quality
and not overstocked, but if the soil is very
poor it may be necessary to give a small feed
once a day, of which pulped mangolds may form
a part if they are plentiful. This extra feeding
is better than stunting the growth, and the aim
is to get a big romping two-year-old colt, filly,
or gelding as the case may be.</p>

<p>Colts not up to the desired standard should
be operated on during their yearling days, preferably
in May or June, and, as before indicated,
merit should be conspicuous in those left for
stud purposes, while the back breeding on
both sides counts for much in a stallion.
That is why Lockinge Forest King, Childwick
Champion, and a few others which could be
named, proved to be such prepotent stock-getters.</p>

<p>After June or July colts should be separated
from fillies unless the colts have been castrated,
and they must be put inside good fences, this
being something of a puzzle to a farmer with
a few paddocks and poor fences. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a second or third-rate young stallion often
causes a good deal of trouble, in fact, more
than he leaves a return for.</p>

<p>For the second winter the young Shires
still need a bit of help. If they are to make,
or are likely to make, anything out of the
common they should be fed liberally, otherwise
a feed of chaff and corn once a day will do,
with a bit of hay to munch at night, but it
must be good wholesome forage.</p>

<p>During their second spring, or when two
years old, they should be put to work as
described in a former chapter, after which they
are able at least to earn their keep; the cost
of rearing on the lines indicated up to this
age will be found to be considerable, so that
a good saleable animal is needed to make the
business a profitable one; but I have kept the
rearing of good sound Shires in view, not
crocks or mongrels.</p>

<p>The effect of the war on the cost of feeding
horses has led the Board of Agriculture
and Fisheries to issue a leaflet telling horse
owners of substitutes for oats. When it was
written beans were relatively cheaper, so was
maize, while rice-meal was recommended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
form part of the mixture, owing to its lower
cost.</p>

<p>Those who have fed horses are aware that
they do not like any food which is of a dusty
nature. It sticks in their nostrils, causing
them annoyance, if not discomfort, which a
horse indicates by blowing its nose frequently.</p>

<p>Any kind of light meal should therefore
be fed either with damp chaff or with pulped
roots, well mixed with the feed in the manner
described elsewhere. If mangolds have to be
purchased at £1 per ton, they help to make
the meals more palatable. The farmer who
grows a variety of corn and roots is usually
able to prepare and blend his own foods so as
to make a diet on which horses will thrive
although oats are scarce.</p>

<p>In Scotland boiled swedes or turnips are
largely used for farm horses, but coal and
labour are now scarce as well as horse corn.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">Care of the Feet</span></h2>

<p>There is no part of a Shire to which more
attention should be paid than the feet, and it
is safe to say that the foot of the present-day
cart-horse is infinitely better than were those
of his ancestors of forty, or even twenty,
years ago. The shape as well as the size has
been improved till the donkey-shaped hoof is
rarely met with, at least in show animals of this
breed.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to keep the feet of
foals, yearlings, and two-year-olds attended to
whether they are required for show or not,
and if they have their feet quietly picked up
and the edges rasped, the heels being lowered
a little when necessary, the hoof is prevented
from breaking, and a better and more durable
hoof well repays the trouble, moreover the
task of fixing the first set of shoes&mdash;which
used to be quite a tough job for the smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
when the colts were neglected till they were
three years old&mdash;is rendered quite easy.</p>

<p>Except for travelling on the road, or when
required for show, there is no advantage in
keeping shoes on young Shires, therefore they
should be taken off when lying idle, or if
worked only on soft ground shoes are not
actually necessary.</p>

<p>Where several are lying together, or even
two, those with shoes on may cause ugly
wounds on their fellows, whereas a kick with
the naked hoof is not often serious. There
is also a possibility that colts turned away to
grass with their shoes on will have the removing
neglected, and thus get corns, so that
the shoeless hoof is always better for young
Shires so long as it is sound and normal. If
not, of course, it should be treated accordingly.</p>

<p>In a dry summer, when the ground is
very hard, it may be advisable to use tips
so that the foot may be preserved, this being
especially necessary in the case of thin and
brittle hoofs.</p>

<p>For growing and preserving good strong
feet in Shire horses clay land seems to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
best, seeing that those reared on heavy-land
farms almost invariably possess tough horn on
which a shoe can be affixed to last till it
wears out.</p>

<p>For the purpose of improving weak feet in
young Shires turning them out in cool clay
land may be recommended, taking care to
assist the growth by keeping the heels open
so that the frog comes into contact with the
ground.</p>

<p>Weakness in the feet has been regarded,
and rightly so, as a bad fault in a Shire stallion,
therefore good judges have always been particular
to put bottoms first when judging.
Horses of all kinds have to travel, which they
cannot do satisfactorily for any length of time
if their feet are ill-formed or diseased, and it
should be borne in mind that a good or a bad
foot can be inherited. “No foot, no horse,”
is an old and true belief. During the past
few years farmers have certainly paid more
attention to the feet of their young stock
because more of them are shown, the remarks
of judges and critics having taught them that
a good top cannot atone for poor bottoms,
seeing that Shires are not like stationary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
engines, made to do their work standing.
They have to spend a good part of their lives
on hard roads or paved streets, where contracted
or tender feet quickly come to grief,
therefore those who want to produce saleable
Shires should select parents with the approved
type of pedals, and see that those of the offspring
do not go wrong through neglect or
mismanagement.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a set of good feet
often places an otherwise moderate Shire above
one which has other good points but lacks
this essential; therefore all breeders of Shires
should devote time and attention to the production
of sound and saleable bottoms, remembering
the oft-quoted line, “The top may come,
the bottom never.” In diseases of the feet it
is those in front which are the most certain to
go wrong, and it is these which judges and
buyers notice more particularly.</p>

<p>If fever manifests itself it is generally in
the fore feet; while side-bone, ring-bone, and
the like are incidental to the front coronets.</p>

<p>Clay land has been spoken of for rearing
Shires, but there are various kinds of soil in
England, all of which can be utilized as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
breeding ground for the Old English type of
cart-horses.</p>

<p>In Warwickshire Shires are bred on free-working
red land, in Herts a chalky soil prevails,
yet champions abound there; while very
light sandy farms are capable of producing
high-class Shires if the farmer thereof sets his
mind on getting them, and makes up for the
poorness or unsuitability of the soil by judicious
feeding and careful management.</p>

<p>It may be here stated that an arable farm
can be made to produce a good deal more horse
forage than one composed wholly of pasture-land,
therefore more horses can be kept on the
former.</p>

<p>Heavy crops of clovers, mixtures, lucerne,
etc., can be grown and mown twice in the season,
whereas grass can only be cut once. Oats and
oat straw are necessary, or at least desirable,
for the rearing of horses, so are carrots, golden
tankard, mangold, etc; consequently an arable-land
farmer may certainly be a Shire horse
breeder.</p>

<p>This is getting away from the subject of
feet, however, and it may be returned to by
saying that stable management counts for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
good deal in the growth and maintenance of
a sound and healthy hoof.</p>

<p>Good floors kept clean, dry litter, a diet
in which roots appear, moving shoes at regular
intervals, fitting them to the feet, and not
rasping the hoof down to fit a too narrow
shoe, may be mentioned as aids in retaining
good feet.</p>

<p>As stated, the improvement in this particular
has been very noticeable since the
writer’s first Shire Horse Show (in 1890), but
perfection has not yet been reached, therefore
it remains for the breeders of the present and
the future to strive after it.</p>

<p>There was a time when exhibitors of
“Agricultural” horses stopped the cracks and
crevices in their horses’ feet with something in
the nature of putty, which is proved by reading
a report of the Leeds Royal of 1861, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
“the judges discovered the feet of one of the
heavy horses to be stopped with gutta-percha
and pitch.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">How to Show a Shire</span></h2>

<p>A few remarks on the above subject will not
come amiss, at least to the uninitiated, for it is
tolerably certain that, other things being equal,
the candidate for honours which makes the
best show when it is actually before the judges
stands the first chance of securing the honours.</p>

<p>It must not be expected that a colt can be
fetched out of a grass field one day and trained
well enough to show himself off creditably in
the ring the next; and a rough raw colt makes
both itself and its groom look small. Training
properly takes time and patience, and it is best
to begin early with the process, from birth
for choice. The lessons need not, and
certainly should not, be either long or severe
at the outset, but just enough to teach the
youngster what is required of him. When
teaching horses to stand at “attention” they
should not be made to stretch themselves out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
as if they were wanted to reach from one
side of the ring to the other, neither should
they be allowed to stand like an elephant on
a tub. They should be taught to stand
squarely on all fours in a becoming and
businesslike way. The best place for the
groom when a horse is wanted to stand still
is exactly in front and facing the animal.
The rein is usually gripped about a foot from
the head. Mares can often be allowed a little
more “head,” but with stallions it may be
better to take hold close to the bit, always
remembering to have the loop end of the rein
in the palm, in case he suddenly rears or
plunges. The leader should “go with his
horse,” or keep step with him, but need not
“pick up” in such a manner as to make it
appear to bystanders that he is trying to make
up for the shortcomings of his horse.</p>

<p>Both horse and man want to practise the
performance in the home paddock a good
many times before perfection can be reached,
and certainly a little time thus spent is better
than making a bad show when the critical
moment arrives that they are both called out
to exhibit themselves before a crowd of critics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>If well trained the horse will respond to
the call of the judges with only a word, and no
whip or stick need be used to get it through
the required walks and trots, or back to its
place in the rank.</p>

<p>There is a class of men who would profit
by giving a little time to training young horse
stock, and that is the farmers who breed but
do not show. Of course, “professional show-men”
(as they are sometimes called) prefer to
“buy their gems in the rough,” and put on the
polish themselves, and then take the profits
for so doing. But why should not the breeder
make his animals show to their very best,
and so get a better price into his own pocket?</p>

<p>Finally, I would respectfully suggest that
if some of the horse show societies were to
have a horse-showing competition, <i>i.e.</i> give
prizes to the men who showed out a horse in
the best manner, it would be both interesting
and instructive to horse lovers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">Origin and Progress of the Shire</span></h2>

<p>It is evident that a breed of comparatively
heavy horses existed in Britain at the time of
the Roman Invasion, when Queen Boadicea’s
warriors met Cæsar’s fighting men (who were
on foot) in war chariots drawn by active but
powerful horses, remarkable&mdash;as Sir Walter
Gilbey’s book on “The Great Horse” says&mdash;for
“strength, substance, courage and docility.”</p>

<p>These characteristics have been retained
and improved upon all down the ages since.
The chariot with its knives, or blades, to mow
down the enemy was superseded by regiments
of cavalry, the animals ridden being the Old
English type of War Horse. In those days it
was the lighter or second-rate animals, what we
may call “the culls,” which were left for agricultural
purposes. The English knight, when
clad in armour, weighed something like 4 cwt.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
therefore a weedy animal would have sunk
under such a burden.</p>

<p>This evidently forced the early breeders to
avoid long backs by breeding from strong-loined,
deep-ribbed and well coupled animals,
seeing that slackness meant weakness and,
therefore, worthlessness for war purposes.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that a long-backed,
light-middled mount with a weight of 4 cwt. on
his back would simply double up when stopped
suddenly by the rider to swing his battle axe
at the head of his antagonist, so we find from
pictures and plates that the War Horse of those
far-off days was wide and muscular in his build,
very full in his thighs, while the saddle in use
reached almost from the withers to the hips,
thus proving that the back was short.</p>

<p>There came a time, however, when speed
and mobility were preferred to mere weight.
The knight cast away his armour and selected
a lighter and fleeter mount than the War Horse
of the ancient Britons.</p>

<p>The change was, perhaps, began at the
battle of Bannockburn in 1314. It is recorded
that Robert Bruce rode a “palfrey” in that
battle, on which he dodged the charges of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
ponderous English knights, and he took a very
heavy toll, not only of English warriors but of
their massive horses; therefore it is not unreasonable
to suppose that some of the latter
were used for breeding purposes, and thus
helped to build up the Scottish, or Clydesdale,
breed of heavy horses; but what was England’s
loss became Scotland’s gain, in that the Clydesdale
breed had a class devoted to it at the
Highland Society’s Show in 1823, whereas his
English relative, “the Shire,” did not receive
recognition by the Royal Agricultural Society
of England till 1883, sixty years later. As a
War Horse the British breed known as “The
Great Horse” seems to have been at its best
between the Norman Conquest, 1066, and the
date of Bannockburn above-mentioned, owing
to the fact that the Norman nobles, who came
over with William the Conqueror, fought on
horseback, whereas the Britons of old used to
dismount out of their chariots, and fight on
foot. The Battle of Hastings was waged
between Harold’s English Army of infantry-men
and William the Conqueror’s Army of
horsemen, ending in a victory for the latter.</p>

<p>The Flemish horses thus became known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
English horse breeders, and they were certainly
used to help lay the foundation of the Old
English breed of cart horses.</p>

<p>It is clear that horses with substance were
used for drawing chariots at the Roman invasion
in the year 55 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, but no great development
in horse-breeding took place in England
till the Normans proved that warriors could
fight more effectively on horseback than on foot.
After this the noblemen of England appear to
have set store by their horses, consequently
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries may be
regarded as the age in which Britain’s breed of
heavy horses became firmly established.</p>

<p>In Sir Walter Gilbey’s book is a quotation
showing that “Cart Horses fit for the dray, the
plough, or the chariot” were on sale at Smithfield
(London) every Friday, the extract being
made from a book written about 1154, and
from the same source we learn that during
the reign of King John, 1199-1216, a hundred
stallions “of large stature” were imported from
the low countries&mdash;Flanders and Holland.</p>

<p>Passing from this large importation to the
time of the famous Robert Bakewell of Dishley
(1726-1795), we find that he too went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Flanders for stock to improve his cart horses,
but instead of returning with stallions he
bought mares, which he mated with his stallions,
these being of the old black breed peculiar&mdash;in
those days&mdash;to Leicestershire. There is no
doubt that the interest taken by this great
breed improver in the Old English type of
cart horse had an effect far more important
than it did in the case of the Longhorn breed
of cattle, seeing that this has long lost its
popularity, whereas that of the Shire horse
has been growing and widening from that day
to this.</p>

<p>Bakewell was the first English stockbreeder
to let his stud animals for the season, and
although his greatest success was achieved
with the Dishley or “New Leicester” sheep,
he also carried on the system with Longhorn
bulls and his cart horses, which were described
as “Bakewell’s Blacks.”</p>

<p>That his horses had a reputation is proved
by the fact that in 1785 he had the honour of
exhibiting a black horse before King George
III. at St. James’s Palace, but another horse
named “K,” said by Marshall to have died in
that same year, 1785, at the age of nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
years, was described by the writer just quoted
as a better animal than that inspected by His
Majesty the King. From the description given
he appears to have had a commanding forehand
and to have carried his head so high that
his ears stood perpendicularly over his fore
feet, as Bakewell held that the head of a cart
horse should. It can hardly be questioned
that he was a believer in weight, seeing that
his horses were “thick and short in body, on
very short legs.”</p>

<p>The highest price he is credited with
getting for the hire of a stallion for a season is
150 guineas, while the service fee at home is
said to have been five guineas, which looks a
small amount compared with the 800 guineas
obtained for the use of his ram “Two
Pounder” for a season.</p>

<p>What is of more importance to Shire horse
breeders, however, is the fact that Robert
Bakewell not only improved and popularized
the Shire horse of his day, but he instituted
the system of letting out sires for the season,
which has been the means of placing good sires
before farmers, thus enabling them to assist in
the improvement which has made such strides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
since the formation of the Shire Horse Society
in 1878.</p>

<p>It is worth while to note that Bakewell’s
horses were said to be “perfectly gentle,
willing workers, and of great power.” He
held that bad pullers were made so by bad
management. He used two in front of a
Rotherham plough, the quantity ploughed being
“four acres a day.” Surely a splendid advertisement
for the Shire as a plough horse.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Flemish Blood</span></h3>

<p>In view of the fact that Flanders has been
very much in the public eye for the past few
months owing to its having been converted into
a vast battlefield, it is interesting to remember
that we English farmers of to-day owe at least
something of the size, substance and soundness
of our Shire horses to the Flemish horse
breeders of bygone days. Bakewell is known
to have obtained marvellous results among his
cattle and sheep by means of in-breeding,
therefore we may assume that he would not
have gone to the Continent for an outcross for
his horses unless he regarded such a step
beneficial to the breed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>It is recorded by George Culley that a
certain Earl of Huntingdon had returned from
the Low Countries&mdash;where he had been
Ambassador&mdash;with a set of black coach horses,
mostly stallions. These were used by the
Trentside farmers, and without a doubt so
impressed Bakewell as to induce him to pay a
visit to the country whence they came.</p>

<p>If we turn from the history of the Shire to
that of the Clydesdale it will be found that the
imported Flemish stallions are credited by the
most eminent authorities, with adding size to
the North British breed of draught horses.</p>

<p>The Dukes of Hamilton were conspicuous
for their interest in horse breeding. One was
said to have imported six black Flemish
stallions&mdash;to cross with the native mares&mdash;towards
the close of the seventeenth century,
while the sixth duke, who died in 1758, imported
one, which he named “Clyde.”</p>

<p>This is notable, because it proves that both
the English and Scotch breeds have obtained
size from the very country now devastated
by war.</p>

<p>It may be here mentioned that one of the
greatest lovers and breeders of heavy horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
during the nineteenth century was schooled on
the Duke of Hamilton’s estate, and he was
eminently successful in blending the Shire and
Clydesdale breeds to produce prizewinners and
sires which have done much towards building
up the modern Clydesdale.</p>

<p>This was Mr. Lawrence Drew, of Merryton,
who, like Mr. Robert Bakewell, had the distinction
of exhibiting a stallion (named Prince
of Wales) before Royalty.</p>

<p>It is well known that he (Mr. Drew)
bought many Shires in the Midland Counties
of England. So keen was his judgment that he
would “spot a winner” from a railway carriage,
and has been known to alight at the next station
and make the journey back to the farm where
he saw the likely animal.</p>

<p>On at least one occasion the farmer would
not sell the best by itself, so the enthusiast
bought the whole team, which he had seen at
plough from the carriage window on the railway.</p>

<p>Quite the most celebrated Shire stallion
purchased by Mr. Drew in England was
Lincolnshire Lad 1196, who died in his possession
in 1878. This horse won several
prizes in Derbyshire before going north, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
he also begot Lincolnshire Lad II. 1365, the
sire of Harold 3703, Champion of the London
Show of 1887, who in turn begot Rokeby
Harold (Champion in London as a yearling, a
three-year-old and a four-year-old), Markeaton
Royal Harold, the Champion of 1897, and of
Queen of the Shires, the Champion mare of
the same year, 1897, and numerous other celebrities.
A great mare, bought by Mr. Drew
in Derbyshire, was Flora, by Lincolnshire
Lad, who became the dam of Pandora, a
great winner, and the dam of Prince of Clay,
Handsome Prince, and Pandora’s Prince, all
of which were Clydesdale stallions and stock-getters
of the first rank.</p>

<p>There is evidence to show that heavy horses
from other countries than Flanders were imported,
but this much is perfectly clear, that
the Flemish breed was selected to impart size,
therefore, if we give honour where it is due,
these “big and handsome” black stallions that
we read of deserve credit for helping to build
up the breed of draught horses in Britain,
which is universally known as the Shire, its
distinguishing feature being that it is the
heaviest breed in existence.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Facts and Figures</span></h2>

<p>The London Show of 1890 was a remarkable
one in more than one sense. The entries
totalled 646 against 447 the previous year.
This led to the adoption of measures to
prevent exhibitors from making more than two
entries in one class. The year 1889 holds the
record, so far, for the number of export
certificates granted by the Shire Horse
Society, the total being 1264 against 346 in
1913, yet Shires were much dearer in the latter
year than in the former.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago the number of three-year-old
stallions shown in London was 161,
while two-year-olds totalled 134, hence the
rule of charging double fees for more than
two entries from one exhibitor.</p>

<p>Another innovation was the passing of a
rule that every animal entered for show
should be passed by a veterinary surgeon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
this being the form of certificate drawn
up:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hereby certify that ________
entered by Mr. ________ for exhibition
at the Shire Horse Society’s London Show,
1891, has been examined by me and, in my
opinion, is free from the following hereditary
diseases, viz: Roaring (whistling), Ringbone,
Unsound Feet, Navicular Disease, Spavin,
Cataract, Sidebone, Shivering.”</p></div>

<p>These alterations led to a smaller show in
1891 (which was the first at which the writer
had the honour of leading round a candidate,
exhibited by a gentleman who subsequently
bred several London winners, and who served
on the Council of the Shire Horse Society).
But to hark back to the 1890 Show. The
Champion Stallion was Mr. A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s
(now Lord Redesdale) Hitchin
Conqueror, one of whose sons, I’m the Sort
the Second, made £1000 at the show after
winning third prize; the second-prize colt in
the same class being sold for £700.</p>

<p>The Champion mare was Starlight, then
owned by Mr. R. N. Sutton-Nelthorpe, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
sold before the 1891 Show, at the Scawby sale,
for 925 guineas to Mr. Fred Crisp&mdash;who held
a prominent place in the Shire Horse world for
several years. Starlight rewarded him by
winning Champion prize both in 1891 and 1892,
her three successive victories being a record in
championships for females at the London Show.
Others have won highest honours thrice, but, so
far, not in successive years.</p>

<p>In 1890 the number of members of the Shire
Horse Society was 1615, the amount given in
prizes being just over £700. A curious thing
about that 1890 meeting, with its great entry,
was that it resulted in a loss of £1300 to the
Society, but in those days farmers did not
attend in their thousands as they do now.</p>

<p>The sum spent in 1914 was £2230, the
number of members being 4200, and the entries
totalling 719, a similar sum being offered, at
the time this is being written, for distribution
at the Shire Horse Show of 1915, which will
be held when this country has, with the help of
her Allies, waged a great war for seven months,
yet before it had been carried on for seven days
show committees in various parts of the country
cancelled their shows, being evidently under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
impression that “all was in the dust.” With
horses of all grades at a premium, any method
of directing the attention of farmers and breeders
generally to the scarcity that is certain to exist
is justifiable, particularly that which provides
for over two thousand pounds being spent
among members of what is admitted to be the
most flourishing breed society in existence.</p>

<p>At the London Show of 1895 two classes
for geldings were added to the prize schedule,
making fifteen in all, but even with twenty-two
geldings the total was only 489, so that it was
a small show, its most notable feature being
that Mr. A. B. Freeman-Mitford’s Minnehaha
won the Challenge Cup for mares and died later.</p>

<p>Up till the Show of 1898 both stallions and
mares commenced with the eldest, so that Class
I was for stallions ten years old and upwards,
the yearlings coming last, the mare classes following
in like order. But for the 1898 Show a
desirable change was made by putting the yearlings
first, and following on with classes in the
order of age. At this show, 1898, Sir Alexander
Henderson performed the unique feat of
winning not only the male and female Challenge
Cups, but also the other two, so that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
had four cup winners, three of them being sire,
dam, and son, viz. Markeaton Royal Harold,
Aurea, and Buscot Harold, this made the victory
particularly noteworthy. The last named also
succeeded in winning champion honours in 1899
and 1900, thus rivalling Starlight. The cup-winning
gelding, Bardon Extraordinary, had
won similar honours the previous year for Mr.
W. T. Everard, his owner in 1898 being Mr.
James Eadie. He possessed both weight and
quality, and it is doubtful if a better gelding has
been exhibited since. He was also cup winner
again in 1899, consequently he holds the record
for geldings at the London Show.</p>

<p>It should have been mentioned that the
system of giving breeders prizes was introduced
at the Show of 1896, the first prizes
being reduced from £25 to £20 in the case
of stallions, and from £20 to £15 in those
for mares, to allow the breeder of the first
prize animal £10 in each breeding class,
and the breeder of each second-prize stallion
or mare £5, the latter sum being awarded to
breeders of first-prize geldings. This was a
move in the right direction, and certainly gave
the Shire Horse Society and its London Show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a lift up in the eyes of farmers who had bred
Shires but had not exhibited. Since then they
have never lost their claim on any good animal
they have bred, that is why they flock to the
Show in February from all parts of England,
and follow the judging with such keen interest;
there is money in it.</p>

<p>This Show of 1896 was, therefore, one of
the most important ever held. It marked the
beginning of a more democratic era in the
history of the Great Horse. The sum of
£1142 was well spent.</p>

<p>By the year 1900 the prize money had
reached a total of £1322, the classes remaining
as from 1895 with seven for stallions, six for
mares, and two for geldings. The next year,
1901, another class, for mares 16 hands 2
inches and over, was added, and also another
class for geldings, resulting in a further rise to
£1537 in prize money. The sensation of this
Show was the winning of the Championship by
new tenant-farmer exhibitors, Messrs. J. and M.
Walwyn, with an unknown two-year-old colt,
Bearwardcote Blaze. This was a bigger surprise
than the success of Rokeby Harold as
a yearling in 1893, as he had won prizes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
his breeder, Mr. A. C. Rogers, and for Mr.
John Parnell (at Ashbourne) before getting
into Lord Belper’s possession, therefore great
things were expected of him, whereas the colt
Bearwardcote Blaze was a veritable “dark
horse.” Captain Heaton, of Worsley, was one
of the judges, and subsequently purchased him
for Lord Ellesmere.</p>

<p>The winning of the Championship by a
yearling colt was much commented on at the
time (1893), but he was altogether an extraordinary
colt. The critics of that day regarded
him as the best yearling Shire ever seen.
Said one, “We breed Shire horses every day,
but a colt like this comes only once in a lifetime.”
Fortunately I saw him both in London
and at the Chester Royal, where he was also
Champion, my interest being all the greater
because he was bred in Bucks, close to where
I “sung my first song.”</p>

<p>Of two-year-old champions there have been
at least four, viz. Prince William, in 1885;
Buscot Harold, 1898; Bearwardcote Blaze,
1901; and Champion’s Goalkeeper, 1913.</p>

<p>Three-year-olds have also won supreme
honours fairly often. Those within the write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>r’s
recollection being Bury Victor Chief, in 1892,
after being first in his class for the two previous
years, and reserve champion in 1891; Rokeby
Harold in 1895, who was Champion in 1893,
and cup winner in 1894; Buscot Harold, in
1899, thus repeating his two-year-old performance;
Halstead Royal Duke in 1909, the
Royal Champion as a two-year-old.</p>

<p>The 1909 Show was remarkable for the
successes of Lord Rothschild, who after
winning one of the championships for the
previous six years, now took both of the
Challenge Cups, the reserve championship,
and the Cup for the best old stallion.</p>

<p>The next and last three-year-old to win was,
or is, the renowned Champion’s Goalkeeper,
who took the Challenge Cup in 1914 for the
second time.</p>

<p>When comparing the ages of the male and
female champions of the London Show, it is
seen that while the former often reach the
pinnacle of fame in their youth, the latter
rarely do till they have had time to develop.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">High Prices</span></h2>

<p>It is not possible to give particulars of sums
paid for many animals sold privately, as the
amount is often kept secret, but a few may be
mentioned. The first purchase to attract great
attention was that of Prince William, by the
late Lord Wantage from Mr. John Rowell in
1885 for £1500, or guineas, although Sir
Walter Gilbey had before that given a real
good price to Mr. W. R. Rowland for the
Bucks-bred Spark. The next sensational
private sale was that of Bury Victor Chief, the
Royal Champion of 1891, to Mr. Joseph Wainwright,
the seller again being Mr. John Rowell
and the price 2500 guineas. In that same
year, 1891, Chancellor, one of Premier’s noted
sons, made 1100 guineas at Mr. A. C. Duncombe’s
sale at Calwich, when eighteen of
Premier’s sons and daughters were paraded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with their sire, and made an average, including
foals, of £273 each.</p>

<p>In 1892 a record in letting was set up by
the Welshpool Shire Horse Society, who gave
Lord Ellesmere £1000 for the use of Vulcan
(the champion of the 1891 London Show) to
serve 100 mares. This society was said to be
composed of “shrewd tenant farmers who expected
a good return for their money.” Since
then a thousand pounds for a first-class sire
has been paid many times, and it is in districts
where they have been used that those in search
of the best go for their foals. Two notable
instances can be mentioned, viz. Champion’s
Goalkeeper and Lorna Doone, the male and
female champions of the London Show of
1914, which were both bred in the Welshpool
district. Other high-priced stallions to be sold
by auction in the nineties were Marmion to
Mr. Fred Crisp from Mr. Arkwright in 1892
for 1400 guineas, Waresley Premier Duke to
Mr. Victor Cavendish (now the Duke of
Devonshire) for 1100 guineas at Mr. W. H. O.
Duncombe’s sale in 1897, and a similar sum
by the same buyer for Lord Llangattock’s
Hendre Crown Prince in the same year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next really high-priced stallion we
must come to the dispersion of the late Lord
Egerton’s stud in April, 1909, when Messrs.
W. and H. Whitley purchased the five-year-old
Tatton Dray King (London Champion in
1908) for 3700 guineas, to join their celebrated
Devonshire stud. At this sale Tatton Herald,
a two-year-old colt, made 1200 guineas to
Messrs. Ainscough, who won the championship
with him at the Liverpool Royal in 1910,
but at the Royal Show of 1914 he figured,
and won, as a gelding.</p>

<p>As a general rule, however, these costly
sires have proved well worth their money.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, the year 1913
will be remembered by the fact that 4100
guineas was given at Lord Rothschild’s sale
for the two-year-old Shire colt Champion’s
Goalkeeper, by Childwick Champion, who, like
Tatton Dray King and others, is likely to
prove a good investment at his cost. Twice
since then he has championed the London
Show, and by the time these lines are read he
may have accomplished that great feat for the
third time, his age being four years old in
1915.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Of mares, Starlight, previously mentioned,
was the first to approach a thousand pounds in
an auction sale.</p>

<p>At the Shire Horse Show of 1893 the late
Mr. Philo Mills exhibited Moonlight, a mare
which he had purchased privately for £1000,
but she only succeeded in getting a commended
card, so good was the company in which she
found herself. The first Shire mare to make
over a thousand guineas at a stud sale was
Dunsmore Gloaming, by Harold. This was
at the second Dunsmore Sale early in 1894,
the price being 1010 guineas, and the purchaser
Mr. W. J. Buckley, Penyfai, Carmarthen,
from whom she was repurchased by the
late Sir P. Albert Muntz, and was again included
in the Dunsmore catalogue of January
27, 1898, when she realized 780 guineas,
Sir J. Blundell Maple being the lucky purchaser,
the word being used because she won
the challenge cup in London, both in 1899 and
1900. Foaled in 1890 at Sandringham, by
Harold (London Champion), dam by Staunton
Hero (London Champion), she was sold at
King Edward’s first sale in 1892 for 200
guineas. As a three- and a four-year-old she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was second in London, and she also won
second prize as a seven-year-old for Sir P. A.
Muntz, finally winning supreme honours at
nine and ten years of age, a very successful
finish to a distinguished career. On February
11th, 1898, another record was set by His
Majesty King Edward VII., whose three-year-old
filly Sea Breeze, by the same sire as Bearwardcote
Blaze, made 1150 guineas, Sir J.
Blundell Maple again being the buyer. The
next mare to make four figures at a stud sale
was Hendre Crown Princess at the Lockinge
sale of February 14, 1900, the successful bidder
being Mr. H. H. Smith-Carington, Ashby
Folville, Melton Mowbray, who has bought
and bred many good Shires. The price was
1100 guineas. This date, February 14, seems
to be a particularly lucky one for Shire sales,
for besides the one just mentioned Lord Rothschild
has held at least two sales on February
14. In 1908 the yearling colt King Cole
VII. was bought by the late Lord Winterstoke
for 900 guineas, the highest price realized
by the stud sales of that year. Then there
is the record sale at Tring Park on February
14, 1913, when one stallion, Champions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Goalkeeper, made 4100 guineas, and another,
Blacklands Kingmaker, 1750.</p>

<p>The honour for being the highest priced
Shire mare sold at a stud sale belongs to the
great show mare, Pailton Sorais, for which Sir
Arthur Nicholson gave 1200 guineas at the
dispersion sale of Mr. Max Michaelis at
Tandridge, Surrey, on October 26, 1911. It
will be remembered by Shire breeders that
she made a successful appearance in London
each year from one to eight years old, her list
being: First, as a yearling; sixth, as a two-year-old;
second, as a three-year-old; first
and reserve champion at four years old, five
and seven; first in her class at six. She was
not to be denied the absolute championship,
however, and it fell to her in 1911. No Shire
in history has achieved greater distinction than
this, not even Honest Tom 1105, who won
first prize at the Royal Show six years in
succession, as the competition in those far-off
days was much less keen than that which
Pailton Sorais had to face, and it should be
mentioned that she was also a good breeder,
the foal by her side when she was sold made
310 guineas and another daughter 400 guineas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the kind of Shire mares that
farmers want. Those that will work, win, and
breed. As we have seen in this incomplete
review, Aurea won the championship of the
London show, together with her son. Belle
Cole, the champion mare of 1908, bred a colt
which realized 900 guineas as a yearling a few
days before she herself gained her victory, a
clear proof that showing and breeding are not
incompatible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>These ten are worthy of special mention,
although there are several which come close
up to the £200 average. That given first is
the most noteworthy for the reason that Lord
Rothschild only sold a portion of his stud,
whereas the executors of the late Lord Egerton
of Tatton sold their whole lot of twenty-one head,
hence the higher average. Two clear records
were, however, set up at the historical Tring
Park sale in 1913, viz. the highest individual
price for a stallion and the highest average
price for animals by one sire, seven sons and
daughters of Childwick Champion, making no
less than £927 each, including two yearling
colts.</p>

<p>The best average of the nineteenth century
was that made at its close by the late Lord
Llangattock, who had given a very high price
privately for Prince Harold, by Harold, which,
like his sire, was a very successful stock horse,
his progeny making a splendid average at this
celebrated sale. A spirited bidder at all of
the important sales and a very successful
exhibitor, Lord Llangattock did not succeed
in winning either of the London Championships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>One private sale during 1900 is worth
mentioning, which was that of Mr. James
Eadie’s two cup-winning geldings, Bardon
Extraordinary and Barrow Farmer for 225
guineas each, a price which has only been
equalled once to the writer’s knowledge.
This was in the autumn of 1910, when Messrs.
Truman gave 225 guineas for a gelding, at
Messrs. Manley’s Repository, Crewe, this
specimen of the English lorry horse being
bought for export to the United States.</p>

<p>In 1894 the late Lord Wantage held a
sale which possessed unique features in that
fifty animals catalogued were all sired by the
dual London Champion and Windsor Royal
(Jubilee Show) Gold Medal Winner, Prince
William, to whom reference has already been
made. The average was just over £116. As
a great supporter of the old English breed,
Lord Wantage, K.C.B., a Crimean veteran,
deserves to be bracketed with the recently
deceased Sir Walter Gilbey, inasmuch as that
in 1890 he gave the Lockinge Cup for the
best Shire mare exhibited at the London show,
which Starlight succeeded in winning outright
for Mr. Fred Crisp in 1892.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Gilbey gave the Elsenham Cup
for the best stallion, value 100 guineas, in
1884, which, however, was not won permanently
till the late Earl of Ellesmere gained
his second championship with Vulcan in 1891.
Since these dates the Shire Horse Society has
continued to give the Challenge Cups both for
the best stallion and mare.</p>

<p>The sales hitherto mentioned have been
those of landowners, but it must not be
supposed that tenant farmers have been unable
to get Shires enough to call a home sale.
On February 5, 1890, Mr. A. H. Clark
sold fifty-one Shires at Moulton Eaugate,
the average being £127 5<i>s.</i>, the striking
feature of this sale being the number of grey
(Thumper) mares.</p>

<p>In February, 1901, Mr. Clark and Mr.
F. W. Griffin, another very successful farmer
breeder in the Fens, held a joint sale at Postland,
the former’s average being £100 6<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>,
and the latter’s £123 9<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, each selling
twenty-five animals.</p>

<p>The last home sale held by a farmer was
that of Mr. Matthew Hubbard at Eaton,
Grantham, on November 1, 1912, when an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
average of £73 was obtained for fifty-seven
lots.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to Harold,
Premier, and Prince William, as sires, but
there have been others equally famous since the
Shire Horse Society has been in existence.
Among them may be mentioned Bar None,
who won at the 1882 London Show for the
late Mr. James Forshaw, stood for service
at his celebrated Carlton Stud Farm for a
dozen seasons, and is credited with having sired
over a thousand foals. They were conspicuous
for flat bone and silky feather, when round
cannon bones and curly hair were much more
common than they are to-day, therefore both
males and females by Bar None were highly
prized; £2000 was refused for at least one of
his sons, while a two-year-old daughter made
800 guineas in 1891. For several years the
two sires of Mr. A. C. Duncombe, at Calwich,
Harold and Premier, sired many winners, and
in those days the Ashbourne Foal Show was
worth a journey to see.</p>

<p>In 1899 Sir P. Albert Muntz took first
prize in London with a big-limbed yearling,
Dunsmore Jameson, who turned out to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
sire of strapping yearlings, two- and three-year-olds,
which carried all before them in the show
ring for several years, and a three-year-old son
made the highest price ever realized at any of the
Dunsmore Sales, when the stud was dispersed
in 1909. This was 1025 guineas given by
Lord Middleton for Dunsmore Jameson II.
For four years in succession, 1903 to 1906,
Dunsmore Jameson sired the highest number
of winners, not only in London, but at all the
principal shows. His service fee was fifteen
guineas to “approved mares only,” a high
figure for a horse which had only won at the
Shire Horse Show as a yearling. Among
others he sired Dunsmore Raider, who in turn
begot Dunsmore Chessie, Champion mare at
the London Shows of 1912 and 1913. Jameson
contained the blood of Lincolnshire Lad on
both sides of his pedigree. By the 1907 show
another sire had come to the front, and his
success was phenomenal; this was Lockinge
Forest King, bred by the late Lord Wantage
in 1889, purchased by the late Mr. J. P. Cross,
of Catthorpe Towers, Rugby, who won first
prize, and reserve for the junior cup with him
in London as a three-year-old, also first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
champion at the (Carlisle) Royal Show the
same year, 1902. It is worth while to study
the breeding of Lockinge Forest King.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Sire</i>&mdash;Lockinge Manners.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Grand sire</i>&mdash;Prince Harold.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Great grand sire</i>&mdash;Harold.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Great great grand sire</i>&mdash;Lincolnshire Lad II. 1365.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Great great great grand sire</i>&mdash;Lincolnshire Lad 1196 (Drew’s).</p>

<p>The dam of Lockinge Forest King was The
Forest Queen (by Royal Albert, 1885, a great
sire in his day); she was first prize winner at
the Royal Show, Nottingham, 1888, first and
champion, Peterborough, 1888, first Bath and
West, 1887 and 1888, and numerous other
prizes. Her dam traced back to (Dack’s)
Matchless (1509), a horse which no less an
authority than the late Mr. James Forshaw
described as “the sire of all time.”</p>

<p>This accounts for the marvellous success of
Lockinge Forest King as a stud horse, although
his success, unlike Jameson’s, came rather late
in his life of ten years. He died in 1909. We
have already seen that he has sired the highest
priced Shire mare publicly sold. At the Newcastle
Royal of 1908, both of the gold medal
winners were by him, so were the two champions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
at the 1909 Shire Horse Show. His
most illustrious family was bred by a tenant
farmer, Mr. John Bradley, Halstead, Tilton,
Leicester. The eldest member is Halstead
Royal Duke, the London Champion of 1909,
Halstead Blue Blood, 3rd in London, 1910,
both owned by Lord Rothschild, and Halstead
Royal Duchess, who won the junior cup in
London for her breeder in 1912. The dam of
the trio is Halstead Duchess III by Menestrel,
by Hitchin Conqueror (London Champion,
1890).</p>

<p>Two other matrons deserve to be mentioned,
as they will always shine in the history
of the Shire breed. One is Lockington Beauty
by Champion 457, who died at a good old
age at Batsford Park, having produced Prince
William, the champion referred to more than
once in these pages, his sire being William the
Conqueror. Then Marmion II (by Harold),
who was first in London in 1891, and realized
1400 guineas at Mr. Arkwright’s sale. Also
a daughter, Blue Ruin, which won at
London Show of 1889 for Mr. R. N. Sutton-Nelthorpe,
but, unfortunately, died from foaling
in that year. Another famous son was Mars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Victor, a horse of great size, and also a
London winner, on more than one occasion.
He was purchased by Mr. (Sir) Walter Gilbey
from Mr. Freeman-Mitford (Lord Redesdale)
in the year of his sire’s&mdash;Hitchin Conqueror’s&mdash;championship
in 1890, for the sum of £1500.
Another was Momus by Laughing Stock.
Blue Ruin was own sister to Prince William,
but the other three were by different sires.</p>

<p>To look at&mdash;I saw her in 1890&mdash;Lockington
Beauty was quite a common mare with
obviously small knees, and none too much
weight and width, her distinguishing feature
being a mane of extraordinary length.</p>

<p>The remaining dam to be mentioned as a
great breeder is Nellie Blacklegs by Bestwick’s
Prince, famous for having bred five sons&mdash;which
were all serving mares in the year
1891&mdash;and a daughter, all by Premier. The
first was Northwood, a horse used long and
successfully by Lord Middleton and the sire
of Birdsall Darling, the dam of Birdsall
Menestrel, London champion of 1904. The
second, Hydrometer, first in London in 1889,
then sold to the late Duke of Marlborough,
and purchased when his stud was dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
in 1893 by the Warwick Shire Horse Society
for 600 guineas. Then came Chancellor, sold
at Mr. A. C. Duncombe’s sale in 1891 for
1100 guineas, a record in those days, to Mr.
F. Crisp, who let him to the Peterborough
Society in 1892 for £500. Calwich Topsman,
another son, realized 500 guineas when sold,
and Senator made 350. The daughter,
rightly named “Sensible,” bred Mr. John
Smith of Ellastone, Ashbourne, a colt foal
by Harold in 1893, which turned out to be
Markeaton Royal Harold, the champion
stallion of 1897. This chapter was headed
“A few records,” and surely this set up by
Premier and Nellie Blacklegs is one.</p>

<p>The record show of the Shire Horse
Society, as regards the number of entries,
was that of 1904, with a total of 862; the
next for size was the 1902 meeting when 860
were catalogued. Of course the smallest show
was the initial one of 1880, when 76 stallions
and 34 mares made a total of 110 entries.
The highest figure yet made in the public
auction sales held at the London Show is
1175 guineas given by Mr. R. Heath, Biddulph
Grange, Staffs., in 1911 for Rickford Coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
King, a three-year-old bred by the late Lord
Winterstoke, and sold by his executors, after
having won fourth in his class, although first
and reserve for the junior cup as a two-year-old.
He was sired by Ravenspur, with which
King Edward won first prize in London, 1906,
his price of 825 guineas to Lord Winterstoke
at the Wolferton Sale of February 8, 1907,
being the highest at any sale of that year.
The lesson to be learned is that if you want
to create a record with Shires you must begin
and continue with well-bred ones, or you will
never reach the desired end.</p>

<p>This list is interesting for the reason that
those who have awarded the prizes at the
Shire Horse Show have, to a great extent,
fixed the type to find favour at other important
shows. Very often the same judges have officiated
at several important exhibitions during
the same season, which has tended towards
uniformity in prize-winning Shires. On looking
down the list, it will be seen that four judges
were appointed till 1895, while the custom of
the Society to get its Council from as many
counties as possible has not been followed in
the matter of judges’ selection. For instance,
Warwickshire&mdash;a great county for Shire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
breeding&mdash;has only provided two judges in twenty-six
years, and one of them&mdash;Mr. Potter&mdash;had
recently come from Lockington Grounds, Derby,
where he bred the renowned Prince William.
For many years Hertfordshire has provided a
string of winners, yet no judge has hailed from
that county, or from Surrey, which contains
quite a number of breeders of Shire horses.
No fault whatever is being found with the
way the judging has been carried out. It is
no light task, and nobody but an expert could,
or should, undertake it; but it is only fair to
point out that high-class Shires are, and have
been, bred in Cornwall, and Devonshire, Kent,
and every other county, while the entries at the
show of 1914 included a stallion bred in the
Isle of Man.</p>

<p>In 1890, as elsewhere stated, the membership
of the Society was 1615, whereas the
number of members given in the 1914 volume
of the Stud Book is 4200. The aim of each
and all is “to improve the Old English breed
of Cart Horses,” many of which may now be
truthfully described by their old title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> “War
Horses.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">The Export Trade</span></h2>

<p>Among the first to recognize the enormous
power and possibilities of the Shire were the
Americans. Very few London shows had been
held before they were looking out for fully-registered
specimens to take across the Atlantic.
Towards the close of the ’eighties a great export
trade was done, the climax being reached
in 1889, when the Shire Horse Society granted
1264 export certificates. A society to safeguard
the interests of the breed was formed in
America, these being the remarks of Mr. A.
Galbraith (President of the American Shire
Horse Society) in his introductory essay:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> “At
no time in the history of the breed have first-class
animals been so valuable as now, the
praiseworthy endeavour to secure the best
specimens of the breed having the natural
effect of enhancing prices all round. Breeders
of Shire horses both in England and America
have a hopeful and brilliant future before them,
and by exercising good judgment in their selections,
and giving due regard to pedigree and
soundness, as well as individual merit, they
will not only reap a rich pecuniary reward,
but prove a blessing and a benefit to this
country.”</p>

<p>From the day that the Shire Horse Society
was incorporated, on June 3, 1878, until now,
America has been Britain’s best overseas customer
for Shire horses, a good second being
our own colony, the Dominion of Canada.
Another stockbreeding country to make an
early discovery of the merits of “The Great
Horse” was Argentina, to which destination
many good Shires have gone. In 1906 the
number given in the Stud Book was 118. So
much importance is attached to the breed both
in the United States and in the Argentine
Republic that English judges have travelled
to each of those country’s shows to award the
prizes in the Shire Classes.</p>

<p>Another great country with which a good
and growing trade has been done is Russia. In
1904 the number was eleven, in 1913 it had
increased to fifty-two, so there is evidently a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
market there which is certain to be extended
when peace has been restored and our powerful
ally sets about the stupendous, if peaceful, task
of replenishing her horse stock.</p>

<p>Our other allies have their own breeds of
draught horses, therefore they have not been
customers for Shires, but with war raging in
their breeding grounds, the numbers must
necessarily be reduced almost to extinction,
consequently the help of the Shire may be
sought for building up their breeds in days
to come.</p>

<p>German buyers have not fancied Shire
horses to any extent&mdash;British-bred re-mounts
have been more in their line.</p>

<p>In 1905, however, Germany was the destination
of thirty-one. By 1910 the number had
declined to eleven, and in 1913 to three, therefore,
if the export of trade in Shires to “The
Fatherland” is altogether lost, English breeders
will scarcely feel it.</p>

<p>Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa
are parts of the British Empire to which
Shires have been shipped for several years.
Substantial prizes in the shape of Cups and
Medals are now given by the Shire Horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Society to the best specimens of the breed
exhibited at Foreign and Colonial Shows.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Encouraging the Export of Shires</span></h3>

<p>The following is reprinted from the “Farmer
and Stockbreeder Year Book” for 1906, and
was written by S. H. L. (J. A. Frost):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Old English breed of cart horse, or
‘Shire,’ is universally admitted to be the best
and most valuable animal for draught purposes
in the world, and a visitor from America, Mr.
Morrow, of the United States Department of
Agriculture, speaking at Mr. John Rowell’s
sale of Shires in 1889, said, ‘Great as had
been the business done in Shire horses in
America, the trade is but in its infancy, for the
more Shire horses became known, and the
more they came into competition with other
breeds, the more their merits for all heavy
draught purposes were appreciated.’</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<p>“These remarks are true to-day, for
although sixteen years have elapsed since they
were made (1906), the massive Shire has more
than held his own, but in the interests of the
breed, and of the nearly four thousand members
of the Shire Horse Society, it is still doubtful
whether the true worth of the Shire horse is
properly known and appreciated in foreign
countries and towns needing heavy horses, and
whether the export trade in this essentially
British breed is not capable of further development.
The number of export certificates
granted by the Shire Horse Society in 1889
was 1264, which takes a good deal of beating,
but it must be remembered that since then
Shire horse breeding at home has progressed
by leaps and bounds, and tenant farmers, who
could only look on in those days, are now
members of the flourishing Shire Horse Society
and owners of breeding studs, and such prices
as 800 guineas for a two-year-old filly and
230 guineas for a nine-months-old colt, are
less frequently obtainable than they were then;
therefore, an increase in the demand from
other countries would find more Shire breeders
ready to supply it, although up to the present
the home demand has been and is very good,
and weighty geldings continue to be scarce
and dear.”</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Number Exported</span></h3>

<p>“It may be true that the number of horses
exported during the last year or two has been
higher than ever, but when the average value
of those that go to ‘other countries’ than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Holland, Belgium, and France, is worked out,
it does not allow of such specimens as would
excite the admiration of a foreign merchant or
Colonial farmer being exported, except in very
isolated instances; then the tendency of American
buyers is to give preference to stallions
which are on the quality rather than on the
weighty side, and as the mares to which they
are eventually put are also light boned, the
typical English dray horse is not produced.</p>

<p>“During the past year (1905) foreign
buyers have been giving very high prices for
Shorthorn cattle, and if they would buy in the
same spirited manner at the Shire sales, a
much more creditable animal could be obtained
for shipment. As an advertisement for the
Shire it is obviously beneficial that the Shire
Horse Society&mdash;which is unquestionably the
most successful breed society in existence&mdash;gives
prizes for breeding stock and also geldings
at a few of the most important horse
shows in the United States. This tends to
bring the breed into prominence abroad, and it
is certain that many Colonial farmers would
rejoice at being able to breed working geldings
of a similar type to those which may be seen
shunting trucks on any large railway station in
England, or walking smartly along in front of
a binder in harvest. The writer has a relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
farming in the North-West Territory of Canada,
and his last letter says, ‘The only thing in the
stock line that there is much money in now is
horses; they are keeping high, and seem likely
to for years, as so many new settlers are
coming in all the time, and others do not seem
able to raise enough for their own needs’; and
it may be mentioned that almost the only kind
of stallions available there are of the Percheron
breed, which is certainly not calculated to
improve the size, or substance, of the native
draught horse stock.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Cost of Shipping</span></h3>

<p>“The cost of shipping a horse from Liverpool
to New York is about £11, which is not
prohibitive for such an indispensable animal as
the Shire horse, and if such specimens of the
breed as the medal winners at shows like
Peterborough could be exhibited in the draught
horse classes at the best horse shows of
America, it is more than probable that at least
some of the visitors would be impressed with
their appearance, and an increase in the export
trade in Shires might thereby be brought
about.</p>

<p>“A few years ago the price of high-class
Shire stallions ran upwards of a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
pounds, which placed them beyond the reach
of exporters; but the reign of what may be
called ‘fancy’ prices appears to be over, at
least for a time, seeing that the general sale
averages have declined since that of Lord
Llangattock in October, 1900, when the record
average of £226 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> was made, although the
best general average for the sales of any single
year was obtained in 1901, viz. £112 5<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
for 633 animals, and it was during that year
that the highest price for Shires was obtained
at an auction sale, the sum being 1550 guineas,
given by Mr. Leopold Salomons, for the
stallion Hendre Champion, at the late Mr.
Crisp’s sale at Girton. Other high-priced
stallions purchased by auction include Marmion
II., 1400 guineas, and Chancellor, 1100
guineas, both by Mr. Crisp. Waresley Premier
Duke, 1100 guineas, and Hendre Crown
Prince, 1100 guineas, were two purchases of
Mr. Victor Cavendish in the year 1897. These
figures show that the worth of a really good
Shire stallion can hardly be estimated, and it
is certain that the market for this particular
class of animal is by no means glutted, but
rather the reverse, as the number of males
offered at the stud sales is always limited,
which proves that there is ‘room on the top’
for the stallion breeder, and with this fact in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
view and the possible chance of an increased
foreign trade in stallions it behoves British
breeders of Shires to see to it that there is no
falling off in the standard of the horses ‘raised,’
to use the American word, but rather that a
continual improvement is aimed at, so that
visitors from horse-breeding countries may
find what they want if they come to ‘the stud
farm of the world.’</p>

<p>“The need to keep to the right lines and
breed from good old stock which has produced
real stock-getting stallions cannot be too
strongly emphasised, for the reason that there
is a possibility of the British market being
overstocked with females, with a corresponding
dearth of males, both stallions and geldings,
and although this is a matter which breeders
cannot control they can at least patronise a
strain of blood famous for its males. The
group of Premier&mdash;Nellie Blacklegs’ brothers,
Northwood, Hydrometer, Senator, and Calwich
Topsman&mdash;may be quoted as showing the
advisability of continuing to use the same
horse year after year if colt foals are bred,
and wanted, and the sire is a horse of merit.</p>

<p>“With the number of breeders of Shire
horses and the plentiful supply of mares,
together with the facilities offered by local
stallion-hiring societies, it ought not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
impossible to breed enough high-grade sires
to meet the home demand and leave a surplus
for export as well, and the latter of the class
that will speak for themselves in other
countries, and lead to enquiries for more of
the same sort.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Few High Prices from Exporters</span></h3>

<p>“It is noteworthy that few, if any, of the
high prices obtained for Shires at public sales
have come from exporters or buyers from
abroad, but from lovers of the heavy breed in
England, who have been either forming or
replenishing studs, therefore, ‘the almighty
dollar’ has not been responsible for the figures
above quoted. Still it is probable that with
the opening up of the agricultural industry in
Western Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere,
Shire stallions will be needed to help the
Colonial settlers to build up a breed of horses
which will be useful for both tillage and
haulage purposes.</p>

<p>“The adaptability of the Shire horse to
climate and country is well known, and it is
satisfactory for home breeders to hear that
Mr. Martinez de Hoz has recently sold ten
Shires, bred in Argentina, at an average of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
£223 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, one, a three-year-old, making
£525.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile it might be a good investment
if a syndicate of British breeders placed a
group of typical Shire horses in a few of the
biggest fairs or shows in countries where
weighty horses are wanted, and thus further
the interests of the Shire abroad, and assist
in developing the export trade.”</p>

<p>It may be added that during the summer
of 1906, H.M. King Edward and Lord Rothschild
sent a consignment of Shires to the
United States of America for exhibition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">Prominent Present-Day Studs</span></h2>

<p>Seeing that Lord Rothschild has won the
greatest number of challenge cups and holds
the record for having made the highest price,
his name is mentioned first among owners of
famous studs.</p>

<p>He joined the Shire Horse Society in
February, 1891, and at the show of 1892
made five entries for the London Show at
which he purchased the second prize three-year-old
stallion Carbonite (by Carbon by
Lincolnshire Lad II.) from Mr. Edward Green
for 1100 guineas. He is remembered by the
writer as being a wide and weighty horse on
short legs which carried long hair in attendance,
and this type has been found at Tring Park
ever since. In 1895 his lordship won first and
third with two chestnut fillies&mdash;Vulcan’s
Flower by the Champion Vulcan and Walkern
Primrose by Hitchin Duke (by Bar None).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
The former won the Filly Cup and was subsequently
sold to help to found the famous stud
of Sir Walpole Greenwell at Marden Park,
Surrey, the sum given being a very high one
for those days.</p>

<p>The first championship was obtained with
the mare Alston Rose in 1901, which won like
honours for Mr. R. W. Hudson in 1902, after
costing him 750 guineas at the second sale at
Tring Park, January 15, 1902.</p>

<p>Solace, bred by King Edward, was the
next champion mare from Lord Rothschild’s
stud. Girton Charmer, winner of the Challenge
Cup in 1905, was included in a select
shipment of Shires sent to America (as models
of the breed) by our late lamented King and
Lord Rothschild in 1906. Princess Beryl, Belle
Cole, Chiltern Maid, were mares to win highest
honours for the stud, while a young mare
which passed through Lord Rothschild’s hands,
and realized a four-figure sum for him as a
two-year-old from the Devonshire enthusiasts,
Messrs. W. and H. Whitley, is Lorna Doone,
the Champion mare of 1914.</p>

<p>Champion’s Goalkeeper, the Tring record-breaker,
has been mentioned, so we can now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
refer to the successful stud of which he is the
central figure, viz. that owned by Sir Walpole
Greenwell at Marden Park, Woldingham,
Surrey, who, as we have seen, bought a good
filly from the Tring Stud in 1895, the year in
which he became a member of the Shire Horse
Society. At Lord Rothschild’s first sale in
1898, he purchased Windley Lily for 430
guineas, and Moorish Maiden, a three-year-old
filly, for 350, since when he has bid only for the
best. At the Tandridge dispersion sale he
gave over a thousand pounds for the Lockinge
Forest King mare, Fuchsia of Tandridge, and
her foal. Sir Walpole was one of the first to
profit by the Lockinge Forest King blood,
his filly, Marden Peach, by that sire having
been a winner at the Royal of 1908, while her
daughter, Marden Constance, has had a brilliant
show career, so has Dunsmore Chessie, purchased
from Mr. T. Ewart as a yearling, twice
London Champion mare.</p>

<p>No sale has been held at Marden, but consignments
have been sold at Peterborough, so
that the prefix is frequently met with.</p>

<p>The stud owner who is willing to give
£4305 for a two-year-old colt deserves success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Primley Stud</span></h3>

<p>At the Dunsmore Sale on February 14, 1907,
Mr. W. Whitley purchased Dunsmore Fuchsia
(by Jameson), the London Cup winner of 1905
and 1906, for 520 guineas, also Quality by the
same sire, and these two won second and third
for him in London the same month, this being
the first show at which the Primley shires took
honours.</p>

<p>The purchase of Tatton Dray King, the
Champion stallion of 1908, by Messrs. W. and
H. Whitley in the spring of 1909 for 3700
guineas created quite a sensation, as it was
an outstanding record, it stood so for nearly
four years.</p>

<p>One of the most successful show mares in
this&mdash;or any&mdash;stud is Mollington Movement
by Lockinge Forest King, but the reigning
queen is Lorna Doone, the London and Peterborough
Champion of 1914, purchased privately
from the Tring Park Stud. Another built on
the same lines is Sussex Pride with which a
Bucks tenant farmer, Mr. R. H. Keene, won
first and reserve champion at the London
Show of 1913, afterwards selling her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Messrs. Whitley, who again won with her in
1914. With such animals as these Devonshire
is likely to hold its own with Shires, although
they do not come from the district known to
the law makers of old as the breeding ground
of “the Great Horse.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Pendley Females</span></h3>

<p>One of the most successful exhibitors of
mares, fillies, and foals, at the shows of the
past few seasons has been Mr. J. G. Williams,
Pendley Manor, Tring. Like other exhibitors
already mentioned, the one under notice owes
much of his success to Lockinge Forest King.
In 1908 Lord Egerton’s Tatton May Queen
was purchased for 420 guineas, she having
been first in London as a yearling and two-year-old;
Bardon Forest Princess, a reserve
London Champion, and Barnfields Forest
Queen, Cup winner there, made a splendid
team of winners by the sire named. At the
Tring Park sale of 1913 Mr. Williams gave the
highest price made by a female, 825 guineas,
for Halstead Duchess VII., by Redlynch
Forest King. She won the Royal Championship
at Bristol for him. One of the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
acquisitions is Snelston Lady, by Slipton King,
Cup winner and reserve Champion in London,
1914, as a three-year-old, first at the Royal,
and reserve Champion at Peterborough. Mr.
Williams joined the Shire Horse Society in
1906, since when he has won all but the
London Championship with his mares and
fillies.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A New Stud</span></h3>

<p>After Champion’s Goalkeeper was knocked
down Mr. Beck announced that the disappointed
bidder was Mr. C. R. H. Gresson,
acting for the Edgcote Shorthorn Company,
Wardington, Banbury, his date of admission
to the Shire Horse Society being during that
same month, February, 1913. Having failed
to get the popular colt, his stable companion
and half brother, Stockman III., was purchased
for 540 guineas, and shown in London just
after, where he won fourth prize. From this
single entry in 1913 the foundation of the stud
was so rapid that seven entries were made at
the 1914 London Show. Fine Feathers was
the first prize yearling filly, Blackthorn Betty
the second prize two-year-old filly, the own bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Edgcote Monarch being the second prize yearling
colt. After the show Lord Rothschild’s
first prize two-year colt, Orfold Blue Blood,
was bought, together with Normandy Jessie,
the third prize yearling colt; so with these two,
Fine Feathers, Betty, Chirkenhill Forest Queen,
and Writtle Coming Queen, the Edgcote Shorthorn
Co., Ltd., took a leading place at the
shows of 1914. In future Edgcote promises
to be as famous for its Shires as it has hitherto
been for its Shorthorns.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ducal Studs</span></h3>

<p>A very successful exhibitor of the past
season has been his Grace the Duke of Westminster,
who owns a very good young sire in
Eaton Nunsuch&mdash;so good that he has been
hired by the Peterborough Society. Shires
have been bred on the Eaton Hall estate for
many years, and the stud contains many promising
animals now.</p>

<p>Mention must be made of the great interest
taken in Shires by the Duke of Devonshire
who, as the Hon. Victor Cavendish, kept a
first-class stud at Holker, Lancs. At the
Royal Show of 1909 (Gloucester) Holker Mars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was the Champion Shire stallion, Warton
Draughtsman winning the Norwich Royal
Championship, and also that of the London
Show of 1912 for his popular owner.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Other Studs</span></h3>

<p>Among those who have done much to promote
the breeding of the Old English type
of cart-horse, the name of Mr. Clement
Keevil deserves a foremost place. At
Blagdon, Malden, Surrey, he held a number
of stud sales in the eighties and nineties, to
which buyers went for massive-limbed Shires
of the good old strains; those with a pedigree
which traced back to Honest Tom (<i>alias</i> Little
David), foaled in the year 1769, to Wiseman’s
Honest Tom, foaled in 1800, or to Samson
a sire weighing 1 ton 8 cwt. Later he had a
stud at Billington, Beds, where several sales
were held, the last being in 1908, when Mr.
Everard gave 860 guineas for the stallion,
Lockinge Blagdon. Shortly before that he
sold Blagdon Benefactor for 1000 guineas.</p>

<p>The prefix “Birdsall” has been seen in
show catalogues for a number of years, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
mean that the animals holding it were bred,
or owned, by Lord Middleton, at Birdsall,
York, he being one of the first noblemen to
found a stud, and he has ably filled the Presidential
Chair of the Shire Horse Society.
As long ago as the 1892 London Show there
were two entries from Birdsall by Lord Middleton’s
own sire, Northwood, to which reference
is made elsewhere.</p>

<p>Another notable sire purchased by his lordship
was Menestrel, first in London, 1900 (by
Hitchin Conqueror), his most famous son being
Birdsall Menestrel, dam Birdsall Darling by
Northwood, sold to Lord Rothschild as a
yearling. As a two-year-old this colt was Cup
winner and reserve Champion, and at four he
was Challenge Cup winner. A good bidder
at Shire sales, the breeder of a champion, and
a consistent supporter of the Shire breeding
industry since 1883, it is regrettable that
champion honours have not fallen to Lord
Middleton himself.</p>

<p>Another stud, which was founded near
Leeds, by Mr. A. Grandage, has now been
removed to Cheshire. Joining the Shire
Horse Society in 1892, his first entry in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
was made in 1893, and four years later, in
1897, Queen of the Shires (by Harold) won
the mare Championship for Mr. Grandage.</p>

<p>In 1909 the winning four-year-old stallion,
Gaer Conqueror, of Lincolnshire Lad descent,
was bought from Mr. Edward Green for 825
guineas, which proved to be a real good investment
for Mr. Grandage, seeing that he
won the championship of the Shire Horse
Show for the two following years, 1910 and
1911.</p>

<p>Candidates from the Bramhope Stud,
Monks Heath, Chelford, Cheshire, are likely
to give a very good account of themselves in
the days to come.</p>

<p>Among those who will have the best Shires
is Sir Arthur Nicholson, Highfield, Leek,
Staffs. His first London success was third
prize with Rokeby Friar (by Harold) as a
two-year-old in 1893, since which date he has
taken a keen personal interest in the breeding
of Shire horses, and has the honour of having
purchased Pailton Sorais, the highest-priced
mare yet sold by auction. At the Tring sale
of 1913 he gave the second highest price of
that day, viz., 1750 guineas for the three-year-old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
stallion, Blacklands Kingmaker, who won
first prize for him in London ten days after,
but, alas, was taken ill during his season, for
the Winslow Shire Horse Society, and died.
Another bad loss to Sir Arthur and to Shire
breeders generally was the death of Redlynch
Forest King, seeing that he promised to rival
his renowned sire, Lockinge Forest King, for
begetting show animals.</p>

<p>Among the many good ones recently exhibited
from the stud may be mentioned Leek
Dorothy, twice first in London, and Leek
Challenger, first as a yearling, second as a two-year-old,
both of these being by Redlynch
Forest King. With such as these coming on
there is a future before the Shires of Sir
Arthur Nicholson.</p>

<p>The name of Muntz is familiar to all Shire
breeders owing to the fame achieved by the
late Sir P. Albert Muntz. In 1899 Mr. F. E.
Muntz, of Umberslade, Hockley Heath, Warwickshire,
a nephew of the Dunsmore Baronet,
joined the Shire Horse Society, and has since
been President. Quite a good share of prizes
have fallen to him, including the Cup for the
best old stallion in London both in 1913 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
1914. The winner, Danesfield Stonewall, was
reserved for the absolute championship on
both occasions, and this typical “Old English
Black” had a host of admirers, while Jones&mdash;the
Umberslade stud groom&mdash;will never forget
his parade before His Majesty King George
at the 1913 show.</p>

<p>It used to be said that Shires did not
flourish south of London, but Mr. Leopold
Salomons, Norbury Park, Dorking, has helped
to prove otherwise. Beginning with one entry
at the 1899 Show, he has entered quite a string
for several years, and the stud contains a
number of high-class stallions, notably Norbury
Menestrel, winner of many prizes, and a particularly
well-bred and promising sire, and King
of Tandridge (by Lockinge Forest King), purchased
by Mr. Salomons at the Tandridge
dispersion sale for 1600 guineas. At the sale
during the London Show of 1914 Mr. Salomons
realized the highest price with his own
bred Norbury Coronation, by Norbury Menestrel,
who, after winning third prize in his class,
cost the Leigh Shire Horse Society 850 guineas,
Norbury George, by the same sire, winning
fifth prize, and making 600 guineas, both being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
three years old. This is the kind of advertisement
for a stud, no matter where its situation.</p>

<p>Another Surrey enthusiast is Sir Edward
Stern, Fan Court, Chertsey, who has been a
member of the Shire Horse Society since 1903.
He purchased Danesfield Stonewall from Mr.
R. W. Hudson, and won several prizes before
re-selling him to Mr. F. E. Muntz. His stud
horses now includes Marathon II., champion
at the Oxford County Show of 1910. Mares
and fillies have also been successfully shown at
the Royal Counties, and other meetings in the
south of England from the Fan Court establishment.</p>

<p>A fine lot of Shires have been got together,
at Tarnacre House, Garstang, and the first
prize yearling at the London Show of 1914,
King’s Choice, was bred by Messrs. J. E.
and A. W. Potter, who also won first with
Monnow Drayman, the colt with which Mr.
John Ferneyhough took first prize as a three-year-old.
With stallions of his type and mares
as wide, deep, and well-bred as Champion’s
Choice (by Childwick Champion), Shires full
of character should be forthcoming from these
Lancashire breeders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The Carlton Stud continues to flourish,
although its founder, the late Mr. James Forshaw,
departed this life in 1908. His business
abilities and keen judgment have been inherited
by his sons, one of whom judged in London
last year (1914), as his father did in 1900.
This being a record in Shire Horse history for
father and son to judge at the great Show of
the breed.</p>

<p>Carlton has always been famous for its
stallions. It has furnished London winners
from the first, including the Champions Stroxton
Tom (1902 and 1903), Present King II. (1906),
and Stolen Duchess, the Challenge Cup winning
mare of 1907.</p>

<p>The sires owned by the late Mr. Forshaw
and his sons are too numerous to mention in
detail. Bar None is spoken of elsewhere.
Another very impressive stallion was What’s
Wanted, the sire of Mr. A. C. Duncombe’s
Premier (also mentioned in another chapter),
and a large family of celebrated sons. His
great grandsire was (Dack’s) Matchless 1509,
a great sire in the Fen country, which travelled
through Moulton Eaugate for thirteen consecutive
seasons. The late Mr. Forsha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>w’s
opinion of him is given on another page. One
of the most successful Carlton sires of recent
years has been Drayman XXIII., whose son,
Tatton Dray King, won highest honours in
London, and realized 3700 guineas when sold.
Seeing that prizes were being won by stallions
from this stud through several decades of last
century, and that a large number have been
travelled each season since, while a very large
export trade has been done by Messrs. Forshaw
and Sons, it need hardly be said that
the influence of this stud has been world-wide.</p>

<p>It is impossible to mention all the existing
studs in a little book like this, but three
others will be now mentioned for the reason
that they are carried on by those who formerly
managed successful studs, therefore they have
“kept the ball rolling,” viz. that of Mr. Thomas
Ewart, at Dunsmore, who made purchases on
his own behalf when the stud of the late
Sir P. A. Muntz&mdash;which he had managed for
so long&mdash;was dispersed, and has since brought
out many winners, the most famous of which
is Dunsmore Chessie. Mr. R. H. Keene,
under whose care the Shires of Mr. R. W.
Hudson (Past-President of the Shire Horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Society) at Danesfield attained to such prominence,
although not actually taking over the
prefix, took a large portion of the land, and
carries on Shire breeding quite successfully on
his own account.</p>

<p>The other of this class to be named is
Mr. C. E. McKenna, who took over the
Bardon stud from Mr. B. N. Everard when
the latter decided to let the Leicestershire
stud farm where Lockinge Forest King spent
his last and worthiest years. Such enterprise
gives farmers and men of moderate means
faith in the great and growing industry of
Shire Horse breeding.</p>

<p>Of stud owners who have climbed to prominence,
although neither landowners, merchant
princes, nor erstwhile stud managers, may be
mentioned Mr. James Gould, Crouchley Lymm,
Cheshire, whose Snowdon Menestrel was first
in his class and reserve for the Stallion Cup
at the 1914 London Show; Messrs. E. and
J. Whinnerah, Warton, Carnforth, who won
seventh prize with Warton Draughtsman in
1910, afterwards selling him to the Duke of
Devonshire, who reached the top of the tree
with him two years later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Henry Mackereth, the new London
judge of 1915, entered the exhibitors’ list at
the London Show of 1899. Perhaps his most
notable horse is Lunesdale Kingmaker, with
which Lord Rothschild won fourth prize in
1907, he being the sire of Messrs. Potter’s
King’s Choice above mentioned.</p>

<p>Many other studs well meriting notice
could be dealt with did time and space permit,
including that of a tenant farmer who named
one of his best colts “Sign of Riches,” which
must be regarded as an advertisement for the
breed from a farmer’s point of view.</p>

<p>Of past studs only one will be mentioned,
that of the late Sir Walter Gilbey, the dispersal
having taken place on January 13, 1915.
The first Shire sale at Elsenham was held in
1885&mdash;thirty years ago&mdash;when the late Lord
Wantage gave the highest price, 475 guineas,
for Glow, by Spark, the average of £172 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
being unbeaten till the Scawby sale of 1891
(which was £198 17<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p>Sir Walter has been mentioned as one of
the founders of the Shire Horse Society; his
services in aid of horse breeding were recognized
by presenting him with his portrait in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
oils, the subscribers numbering 1250. The
presentation was made by King Edward (then
Prince of Wales) at the London Show of
1891.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="smcap smaller">The Future Outlook</span></h2>

<p>This book is written when war, and all that
pertains to it, is the absorbing topic. In
fact, no other will be listened to. What is the
good of talking about such a peaceful occupation
as that of agriculture while the nation is fighting
for its very existence? To a certain extent
this can be understood, but stock breeding,
and more particularly horse breeding, cannot
be suspended for two or three seasons and
then resumed without causing a gap in the
supply of horses coming along for future use.</p>

<p>The cry of the army authorities is for “more
and more men,” together with a demand for a constant
supply of horses of many types, including
the weight-moving War Horse, and if the supply
is used up, with no provision being made for a
quantity of four-footed recruits to haul the
guns or baggage waggons in the days to come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the British Army, and most others, will be
faced with a problem not easily solved.</p>

<p>The motor-mad mechanic may think that
his chance has come, but generals who have to
lead an army over water-logged plains, or snow-covered
mountains, will demand horses, hitherto&mdash;and
henceforth&mdash;indispensable for mounting
soldiers on, rushing their guns quickly into
position, or drawing their food supplies and
munitions of war after them.</p>

<p>When the mechanic has provided horseless
vehicles to do all this, horse breeding can be
ignored by fighting men&mdash;not before. But
horses, particularly draft horses, are needed
for commercial use. So far, coal merchants
are horse users, while brewers, millers, and
other lorry users have not altogether discarded
the horse-drawn vehicle.</p>

<p>For taking loads to and from the landing
stage at Liverpool heavy horses will be in
great demand after the war&mdash;perhaps greater
than they have ever been. The railways will
continue to exist, and, while they do, powerful
Shire geldings must be employed; no other
can put the necessary weight into the collar
for shunting loaded trucks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>During the autumn of 1914 no other kind
of advice&mdash;although they got plenty of it&mdash;was
so freely and so frequently given to farmers
as this, “grow more wheat.”</p>

<p>If this has been acted upon, and there is
no doubt that it has, at least to some extent, it
follows, as sure as the night follows the day,
that more horses will be required by those
who grow the wheat. The land has to be
ploughed and cultivated, the crop drilled, cut,
carted home and delivered to mill, or railway
truck, all meaning horse labour.</p>

<p>It may happen that large farmers will use
motor ploughs or steam waggons, but these
are beyond the reach of the average English
farmer. Moreover, when bought they depreciate
in value, whether working or standing
idle, which is exactly what the Shire gelding
or brood mare does not do. If properly cared
for and used they appreciate in value from the
time they are put to work until they are six
or seven years old, and by that age most
farmers have sold their non-breeders to make
room for younger animals. Horse power is
therefore the cheapest and most satisfactory
power for most farmers to use in front of field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
implements and farm waggons, a fact which is
bound to tell in favour of the Shire in the
coming times of peace which we anticipate.</p>

<p>When awarding prizes for the best managed
farm, the judges appointed by the Royal Agricultural
Society of England are instructed to
consider&mdash;</p>

<p>“General Management with a view to
profit,” so that any breed of live stock which
leaves a profit would help a competitor.</p>

<p>Only a short time ago a Warwickshire
tenant farmer told his landlord that Shire
horses had enabled himself and many others
to attend the rent audit, “with a smile on his
face and the rent in his pocket.”</p>

<p>Most landlords are prepared to welcome a
tenant in that state, therefore they should continue
to encourage the industry as they have
done during the past twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Wars come to an end&mdash;the “Thirty Years’
War” did&mdash;so let us remember the Divine
promise to Noah after the flood, “While the
earth remaineth seedtime and harvest … shall
not cease,” Gen. 8:22. As long as there is
sowing and reaping to be done horses&mdash;Shire
horses&mdash;will be wanted.</p>
